"plot: two teen couples go to a church party, drink and then drive. 
 they get into an accident.

 critique: a mind- fuck movie for the teen generation that touches on a very cool idea, but presents it in a very bad package. 
 which is what makes this review an even harder one to write, since i generally applaud films which attempt to break the mold, mess with your head and such( lost highway& memento), but there are good and bad ways of making all types of films, and these folks just did n't snag this one correctly 
. 
 they seem to have taken this pretty neat concept, but executed it terribly. 
 so what are the problems with the movie? 
 well, its main problem is that it 's simply too jumbled 
. 
 it starts off"" normal"" but then downshifts into this"" fantasy"" world in which you, as an audience member, 
 have no idea what 's going on 
. 
 there are dreams, there are characters coming back from the dead, there are others who look like the dead, there are strange apparitions, there are disappearances, there are a looooot of chase scenes, there are tons of weird things that happen, and most of it is simply not explained. 
 now i personally do n't mind trying to unravel a film every now and then, but when all it does is give me the same clue over and over again, i get kind of fed up after a while, which is this film 's biggest problem. 
 it 's obviously got this big secret to hide, but it seems to want to hide it completely until its final five minutes. 
 and do they make things entertaining, thrilling or even engaging, in the meantime? 
 not really.

"the happy bastard 's quick movie review damn 
 that y2k bug. 
 it 's got a head start in this movie starring jamie lee curtis and another baldwin brother( william this time) in a story regarding a crew of a tugboat that comes across a deserted russian tech ship that has a strangeness to it when they kick the power back on. 
 little do they know the power within... 
 going for the gore and bringing on a few action sequences here and there, virus 
 still feels very empty, like a movie going for all flash and no substance. 
 we do n't know why the crew was really out in the middle of nowhere, we do n't know the origin of what took over the ship( just that a big pink flashy thing hit the mir), and, of course, we do n't know why donald sutherland is stumbling around drunkenly throughout. 
 here, it 's just 
"" hey, let 's chase these people around with some robots"". 
 the acting is below average, even from the likes of curtis. 
 you 're more likely to get a kick out of her work in halloween h20. 
 sutherland is wasted and baldwin, well, he 's acting like a baldwin, of course. 
 the real star here are stan winston 's robot design, some schnazzy cgi, and the occasional good gore shot, like picking into someone 's brain. 
 so, if robots and body parts really turn you on, here 's your movie. 
 otherwise, it 's pretty much a sunken ship of a movie.

"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch. 
 based on the late 1960 's television show by the same name, the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover. 
 however, things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion. 
 of course, the ads make it seem like so much more. 
 quick cuts, cool music, claire dane 's nice hair and cute outfits, car chases, stuff blowing up, and the like. sounds like a cool movie, 
 does it not? 
 after the first fifteen minutes, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not. 
 the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production, complete with nice hair and costumes, but that simply is n't enough. 
 the film is best described as a cross between an hour- long cop show and a music video, both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half. and 
 with it comes every single clich? 
. 
 it does n't really matter that the film is based on a television show, as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we 've already seen. 
 the characters and acting is nothing spectacular, sometimes even bordering on wooden. 
 claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored, which really transfers onto the audience. 
 the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi, who plays the resident crazy man, ultimately being the only thing worth watching. 
 unfortunately, even he 's not enough to save this convoluted mess, as 
 all the characters do n't do much apart from occupying screen time. 
 with the young cast, cool clothes, nice hair, and hip soundtrack, it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset. 
 despite an american' r' rating( which the content does not justify), the film is way too juvenile for the older mindset.

" quest for camelot"" is warner bros.'

 the only other recent challenger to their throne was last fall 's promising, if flawed, 20th century fox production"" anastasia,"" but disney 's"" hercules,"" with its lively cast and colorful palate, had her beat hands- down when it came time to crown 1997 's best piece of animation. 
 this year, it 's no contest, as"" quest for camelot"" is pretty much dead on arrival. 
 even the magic kingdom at its most mediocre 
 -- that 'd be"" pocahontas"" for those of you keeping score -- is n't nearly as dull as this. 
 the story revolves around the adventures of free- spirited kayley( voiced by jessalyn gilsig), the early- teen daughter of a belated knight from king arthur 's round table. 
 kayley 's only dream is to follow in her father 's footsteps, and she gets her chance when evil warlord ruber( gary oldman), an ex- round table member- gone- bad, steals arthur 's magical sword excalibur and accidentally loses it in a dangerous, booby- trapped forest. 
 with the help of hunky, blind timberland- dweller garrett( carey elwes) and a two- headed dragon( eric idle and don rickles) that 's always arguing with itself, kayley just might be able to break the medieval sexist mold and prove her worth as a fighter on arthur 's side. 
"" quest for camelot"" is missing pure showmanship, an essential element if it 's ever expected to climb to the high ranks of disney.

"synopsis: a mentally unstable man undergoing psychotherapy saves a boy from a potentially fatal accident and then falls in love with the boy 's mother, a fledgling restauranteur. 
 unsuccessfully attempting to gain the woman 's favor, he takes pictures of her and kills a number of people in his way. 
 comments: stalked is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned- psychos- getting- their- revenge type movies which are a stable category in the 1990s film industry, both theatrical and direct- to- video. 
 their proliferation may be due in part to the fact that they 're typically inexpensive to produce( no special effects, no big name stars) and serve as vehicles to flash nudity( allowing them to frequent late- night cable television). 
 stalked wavers slightly from the norm in one respect: the psycho never actually has an affair; on the contrary, he 's rejected rather quickly( the psycho typically is an ex- lover, ex- wife, or ex- husband). 
 other than that, stalked is just another redundant entry doomed to collect dust on video shelves and viewed after midnight on cable. 
 stalked does not provide much suspense, though that is what it sets out to do. 
 interspersed throughout the opening credits, for instance, a serious- sounding narrator spouts statistics about stalkers and ponders what may cause a man to stalk( it 's implicitly implied that all stalkers are men) while pictures of a boy are shown on the screen. 
 after these credits, a snapshot of actor jay underwood appears. 
 the narrator states that"" this is the story of daryl gleason"" and tells the audience that he is the stalker. 
 of course, really, this is the story of restauranteur brooke daniels. 
 if the movie was meant to be about daryl, then it should have been called stalker not stalked.

"capsule: in 2176 on the planet mars police taking into custody an accused murderer face the title menace. 
 there is a lot of fighting and not a whole lot of story otherwise. 
 john carpenter reprises so many ideas from his previous films, especially assault on precinct 13, that the new film comes off as his homage to himself. 
, 0( -4 to +4). 
 john carpenter apparently believes that action scenes in which people fight something horrible are the same as horror scenes. 
 for a writer and director of horror films, supposedly an expert on horror, 
 it is a very bad mistake to make. 
 ghosts of mars is called a horror movie, but it is more just a drawn out fight between humans and a surprisingly low- powered alien menace. 
 in addition if anybody but john carpenter had made ghosts of mars, carpenter would have grounds to sue. 
 this film is just chock full of pieces taken from assault on precinct 13, the thing, and prince of darkness. 
 it is, in fact, surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way. 
 but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience. 
 ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176. 
 mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear( which is good for the film 's budget). 
 it is never mentioned, but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth- normal, again making it easier to film. 
 society has changed a bit by that time, but it has advanced surprisingly little. 
 apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control. 
 and from carpenter 's view, women have really made a mess of things. 
 society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten.

 is it about a wholesome surveillance man who loses sight of his values after becoming enmeshed in the seedy, sleazy underworld of hardcore pornography?

"that 's exactly how long the movie felt to me. 
 there were n't even nine laughs in nine months. 
 it 's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man, mr. hugh grant, a huge dork. 
 it 's not the whole oral- sex/ prostitution thing( referring to grant, not me) that bugs me, it 's the fact that grant is annoying. 
 not just adam sandler- annoying, we 're talking jim carrey- annoying. 
 since when do 
 eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting? 
 but, on the other hand, since when do really bad slapstick( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant 's head in joan cusack 's lap -- a scene he paid$ 60 to have included in the movie) and obscene double entendres( robin williams, the obstetrician, tells grant 's pregnant girlfriend she has"" a big pussy,"" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat, but nonetheless, grant paid$ 60 to have the exchange included in the movie) pass for comedy? 
 nine months is a predictable cookie- cutter movie with 
 no originality in humor or plot. 
 hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist. 
 why a child psychologist? 
 so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange: 
 kid: my dad 's an asshole. 
 grant( flutters eyelashes, offers a nervous smile, then responds in his annoying english accent and i- think- i- actually- have- talent attitude): could you possibly elaborate on that? 
 kid: 
 my dad 's a_ huge_ asshole. 
 more like a hugh asshole, but that 's beside the point, which is: nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief. 
 so, anyway, grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction( fluttered eyelashes, nervous smiles).

"call it a road trip for the walking wounded. 
 stellan skarsg? 
 rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it 's difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly, boozed- out presence. 
 yet this ever- reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen, 
 a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama. 
 playwright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets, unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late. 
 that 's an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for, focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father, tomas( skarsg? rd) and his alienated, openly hostile yuppie daughter, kaisa( lena headey, gossip). 
 they have n't spoken in years, and would n't even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen, scotland by automobile if it were n't for kaisa 's mother( charlotte rampling, under the sand) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer. 
 in a soap opera twist, mother has only a few days to live.

 despite his sloshed viewpoint, tomas recognizes that the apple has n't fallen very far from the tree. 
 kaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke, sabotages her personal relationships through indifference, and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper.

"janeane garofalo in a romantic comedy

 simmons goes to hell and back, after making a deal with satan himself -- if he agrees to command the devil 's army to overtake the world, he 'll be allowed to return to earth to see his wife wanda( underused theresa randle) and little girl cyan( sydni beaudoin).

" in dreams"" might keep you awake at night, but not because of its creepy imagery, bizarre visual style or story about a clairvoyant madman who lures young girls to their untimely deaths. 
 no, the source of potential sleeplessness here lies within the movie 's brutally squandered potential, the least of which is an admittedly nifty premise- even by tired serial killer genre standards.

"forgive the fevered criticism but the fervor of the crucible infects. 
 set in 1692 at salem, massachusetts, the crucible opens with a group of teenage girls passionately singing and dancing around a boiling cauldron in the middle of a forest under the glow of a full moon. 
 they beckon the names of men as the targets of their love spells. 
 then one of the girls lets her hair down and sheds her clothes. 
 not to be outdone in her quest to regain the attention of john proctor( daniel day lewis), abigail( winona ryder) suddenly seizes a chicken, beats it against the ground and smears her face and lips with the fresh blood. 
 taking even adolescent hormone surges into account, surely this chicken- bashing bit is a bit excessive, especially for prim puritan sensibilities? 
 surely to the puritan eye this is as close to a coven of witches as it gets? 
 the crucible errs from the beginning and arthur miller 's name should be summoned for blame here for the addition of the above scene to his screen adaptation of his play.

 a bad start to an already shaky morality tale. 
 the play describes the film 's opening scene during tense exchanges that makes one wonder about the veracity of both accusation and reply, and this adds to the play 's charged atmosphere. 
 in the film, the opening scene becomes an unintentional pandora 's box. 
 not only is credulity stretched but abigail 's obsession is unfortunately spotlighted. 
 it positions the crucible more as a cautionary fable about obsessive and malevolent women than against witch hunts; it will bring back the memory of a rabbit boiling away in a pot. 
 not surprisingly, the nighttime forest frenzy does not go unnoticed and when two girls fail to wake the following morning, witches are invoked by those eager to blame.

 however, his latest creation, in praise of love, is possibly the most exasperating film experience of the year.

 like most of shelton 's other great films( bull durham, white men ca n't jump) 
, this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots. 
 shelton 's films are not considered sports films, but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story. 
 shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions. 
 play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull, but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse. 
 the film has no social message like its predecessors. 
 the relationship between the friends, two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars, is very confusing for a number of reasons. 
 the whole film, since it is primarily a"" buddy picture,"" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other. 
 unfortunately, it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below. 
 1) 
 we never see how cesar( antonio banderas) and vince( woody harrelson) meet. 
 the two are so different from each other, that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory. 
 2) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas. 
 there is not one convincing moment dedicated to seeing the characters laugh together or actually agree on something. 
 3) 
 the third character on the trip, grace( lolita davidovich) stands in the way. 
 she is in nearly every scene with them, making it impossible to understand the difficulty the two male characters are going to have when they fight each other. 
 4) there are two many interfering, irrelevant side stories.

"some movies i should just skip. 
 my daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back, and here comes another disney effects- filled live- action flick based on an old tv program. 
 true, the probgram is only 15 years old this time, and it 's a cartoon. 
 but it 's a cartoon i liked, and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen. 
 but my daughter really wanted to go, and how bad could it be?

 inspector gadget, oddly enough, follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian, down to the jive- talking side- kick. 
 at first i thought it was done by the same people, but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin, where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver.

"hong kong cinema has been going through a bad spell. 
 the last few productions have been effect laded action adventures that combine both the best and worst of american filmmaking with the same qualities of hong kong films. 
 in a nutshell, the current crop of films from hong kong has been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous. 
 with the one time british colony reverting back to mainland ownership, a lot of hong kong 's best talents have crossed the pacific to work on u. s. productions. 
 such talents as jackie chan( rush hour), chow yun- fat( anna& the king, the corrupter) and yuen woo- ping( the matrix) have all moved into the budget bloated world of hollywood filmmaking with mixed results.

"" the replacements is a hokey mistake of a football film, a mishmash collage of one- dimensional characters, rampant stereotypes of cultures and races, cliched emotional statements of purpose, and keanu reeves wishing for the matrix sequel to start principal photography. 
 the story is loosely based around the pro football players' strike in 1987 and a rag- tag team of replacement football players taking up the reins of professional play for a variety of teams with names like the washington sentinels. 
 keanu reeves stars as shane falco, a has- been football college player looking for redemption. 
 gene hackman dons a fedora like tom landry and speaks with gusto like a certain coach in hoosiers. 
 rounding out the cast includes swingers' jon favreau, 7-up pitchman orlando jones, gruff owner jack warden, and cast of wacky and unknown actors who do amazing jobs of portraying perfectly stereotyped characters: the drunken welshman, the overweight sumo wrestler, the black convict, the violent cop, and the dumb, dumb cheerleaders. 
 this bunch of nobodies try to make something of themselves by taking the team to the season playoffs with unbelievable football plays, gene hackman yelling and asking himself where the hell dennis hopper is, keanu reeves looking for his body double making him look good on the football field, and cheerleaders hired from the local strip club making the girls from coyote ugly look like waitresses from denny 's.

"if you 're into watching near on two hours of bored, foul- mouthed florida teens having sex, doing drugs, having sex, listening to eminem, having sex, playing video games, having sex, and killing one of their peers, then"" bully"" 's for you. 
 based on jim schutze 's novelization of a true- life event,"" bully"" charts the story of a handful of disenchanted teenagers who, in 1993, murdered their high school bully in cold, calculated blood. 
 the film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers. 
 in the hands of controversial director larry clark("" kids""), however, it has less to say about its subject matter and more to say about the filmmaker 's pornographic proclivities. 
 in terms of the incident and what provoked it,"" bully"" stirs up nothing new. 
 the high schoolers are presented as a uniformly screwed up lot -- bored with life, not much ambition, promiscuous, profane.

"among multitude of erotic thrillers, that had been released in the early 1990s, woman of desire is interesting only because it was directed by robert ginty, star of the b- grade action films of the previous decade. 
 those who tend not to be nostalgic about 1980s can find very good reason in the type of movies that made ginty the star. 
 as director, ginty did very little to improve that impression. 
 the protagonist of the movie is jack( played by jeff fahey), yacht skipper that falls madly in love with christina ford( played by bo derek). 
 however, she has relationship with rich and powerful jonathan ashby( steven bauer). 
 one stormy night, the tragedy occurs and jack is accused of rape and murder. 
 however, his good friend walter j. hill( robert mitchum) happens to be very good lawyer, so jack might even prove his innocence in the end. belonging more to the genre of courtroom drama than erotic thriller, woman of desire distinguishes itself from similar films by having almost all characters behaving like total idiots. 
 unfortunately, this film is n't comedy and any laugh is unintentional. 
 the characters are totally antipathetic and irritating and soon we stop caring what would happen to them. 
 the actors that play them do n't help either. 
 that is especially the case with jeff fahey, whose jack is so stupid that even the character played by fahey in lawnmower man looks like a genius in comparison. 
 his partner bo derek, on the other hand, shows that she did n't age enough to cease being the sex goddess, but that is small compensation for her apparent lack of acting talents. 
 ginty, on the other hand, tries to bring some life in the movie by using many flashbacks and strange angles of shooting, but in the end it gets only irritating to the already bored and dissatisfied viewer.

 i did n't agree with that assessment, but i could see what was being implied: the reviewer felt as if the audience was being incited to stand up and pump their fists and shout"" do' er, man, do' er!"" that sentiment is echoed ad nauseam throughout starship troopers. 
 it 's* literally* like a giant recruitment film that has gone berserk. 
 it tries frantically to enlist our emotions but it winds up only being dull or sickening.

 to counterattack, humankind does the single stupidest thing imaginable: instead of nuke the planet from orbit, which they 're clearly capable of, they send down grunts with m-16 rifles.

"all through its production and into the early days of its initial, aborted pre- release publicity, hard rain bore the appropriate moniker of the flood. 
 ultimately, however, paramount pictures, nervous that this movie would be confused with 1996 's other, underperforming disaster films( dante 's peak, volcano), changed the title and shifted the release date by nearly a year. 
 but, to paraphrase the bard, swill, by any other name, would smell as rank. 
 no number of name changes can help this picture. 
 it 's not just about a disaster, it is a disaster. 
 hard rain is the case of a movie that gets progressively worse with every passing minute. 
 the best shot occurs during the opening credits, as the camera pans over the streets and byways of huntingburg, indiana as the water level slowly rises. 
 the community, protected by an overworked dam, is being evacuated as the rain continues to pour relentlessly from the cloud- choked skies. 
 from that moment on, it 's all downhill. 
 whatever initial entertainment value the film possesses has long since drained away by the halfway point. 
 it takes forever to get to the end credits -- this is one of the longest- seeming 95-minute motion pictures i have recently endured. 
 basically, hard rain is one extended, dull chase sequence punctuated by occasional shoot- outs. 
 there 's a lot of water, broken glass, gunfire, and explosions. 
 it 's all very routine and uninteresting 
 because there are n't any real characters and the plot only occasionally makes sense. 
 the film 's conclusion is so preposterous that it 's almost worth watching for the sheer masochistic enjoyment of seeing the monumentally idiotic way that the film makers decide to resolve the myriad subplots that are floating around. 
 action films are supposed to become progressively more invigorating as they rush towards a conclusion.

 i have a name for it myself:"" gross"". 
 this is the sort of film where somebody stands up to a bully, the bully looks at the"" rebel"" threateningly, about to hurt him, and then everyone else whom the bully has heretofore controlled stands up too. 
 how that scene is still present in so many movies today appalls me: are n't present day moviegoers beyond being"" inspired"" by something like that? 
 this is one example( there are actually some more in instinct alone) of filmmakers insulting the audience 's intelligence. 
 instinct 's plot is brimming with potential: world- renowned anthropologist ethan powell( anthony hopkins) disappeared for two years whilst doing research in the jungles of africa. 
 he was found and is coming back to the united states a convicted killer; he murdered to african policemen who were allegedly trying to capture him. 
 after committing a few more brutal acts of violence in the airport, the authorities stick him in a prison 's"" psychotics ward"". assigned to do an evaluation on powell is a bright( or so we are told) young psychiatrist theo caulder( cuba gooding jr.). 
 caulder starts out doing the evaluation merely for the purpose of furthering his career. 
 of course( and no mainstream filmmaker would ever have it any other way) 
 he starts really caring for powell and he becomes fixed on helping powell prove that he is not a psychotic and that he should not be in prison. 
 and then there 's the inevitable"" heartless meanie"" character, in the form of donald sutherland who plays caulder 's mentor. 
 he cares for caulder but does everything he can to discourage him from helping powell.

"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality. 
 he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades, like twelve angry men, serpico or the verdict. 
 but, in the same time, almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers 
 that hamper lumet 's reputation. 
 a stranger among us, 1992 rip- off of peter weir 's witness, belongs to the latter category. 
 the heroine of this movie is emily eden( melanie griffith), tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york. 
 during one of such actions, her partner nick( jamey sheridan) got hurt and as a result, she becomes depressed. 
 in order to help her recover, bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community. 
 emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder. 
 concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community, she decides to go undercover. 
 that is n't easy, because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways. 
 things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel( eric thal). using peter weir 's formula is n't the greatest flaw of this film. 
 even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent. 
 but the worst insult 
 to viewer 's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith. 
 the author of this review never liked this actress very much, but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles. 
 role of emily eden, unfortunately, is n't one of them. 
 first of all, she ca n't pass for tough nypd street fighter, and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman is n't much better.

"my giant is two movies for the price of one, but neither is worth the cost of admission, even if you get in free. 
 as lamely directed by michael lehmann, the picture tries to be a comedy by using and reusing every giant joke in the book. 
("" without goliath, david is just some punk throwing rocks."") 
 languidly paced throughout, the movie becomes increasingly lugubrious 
 as the screenplay by david seltzer( the omen) meanders toward its sad ending. 
 since it 's rarely funny or convincingly dramatic, what the filmmakers thought they were doing remains a mystery. 
 other than a few nice visuals, there 's nothing to recommend the picture. 
 with great film comedies under his belt from when harry met sally? 
 to the original city slickers, billy crystal has shown that he 's more than the world 's best oscar host. 
 he does, however, have a propensity for choosing hopeless material 
 as in last year 's father 's day and this year 's my giant. 
 one wonders if he reads the script before agreeing to go ahead with a project. 
 surely reading the one for my giant would have shown that there was nothing there. 
 perhaps he thought he could ad lib it into success. 
 or maybe he wants to be a dramatic actor and thought he could do something serious with the movie 's somber tone. 
 the most charitable thing that could be said about it is that it is so ineffectual that people will probably forget 
 they saw it by the next day.

 spice world is the feature film debut of the pre- fabricated pop band, the spice girls.

 the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles, and about as talented.

 tenley, a name only a hack screenwriter could invent, is unlike her snobbish counterparts and falls for ryan. if you ca n't figure out where all this nonsense leads, then you need a remedial course in film viewing. 
 as always prinze is pretty to look at, but his performance mainly consists of facial expressions: puppy dog love, heartbreak, frustration, self- loathing or determination. 
 biel cries a lot, while bruce davison merely acts smarmy as her class- conscious father.

 on top of that problem, he has a drunk, gambling addicted partner( penn) who has a penchant for collecting parking tickets( i guess cops are n't immune?).

 mankind has been become an endangered species thanks to the conquest of a race of aliens called the psychlos( sounds like either the latest clown act from cirque de soleil or a white rap group). 
 a small band of humans dwell in radioactive caves located in the rockies in fear of the` demons' who dwell in the cities below. 
 the psychlos are strip- mining the earth for its resources and terel, played by travolta, is the head of security for the mining/ slave base located in denver.

 wesley snipes plays a james bondish type secret agent working for the u. n. after a chinese ambassador is killed, he is on the track of the killer, trying to find out who it is, how it happened, where the killer was, and what to do. 
 anne archer plays his"" boss"" type person of the u. n. 
 and she has hired snipes to track down the killer. 
 well snipes is mistakenly framed as the killer, and is now an outlaw, kidnapping a chinese woman with him, and having her help him along the way.

 edward norton is an insomniac trying to enlighten his dull life by going to a variety of disease therapy sessions, until he meets marla( helena bonham carter). 
 norton claims that she is wrecking his pleasurable lifestyle, when he spots her at a session that he also attended. 
 apparently the disease sessions help them see what life is like, literally living in pain. 
 why any person would think of such a thing is beyond me, but things do get worse.

 how do they come up with this stuff?

 in flashback, we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover, and then we watch in real- time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind.

 this time, keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking- clock cat- and- mouse game with james spader, a burnt- out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd. 
 to taunt spader, who has relocated to chicago, reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too. 
 before long, he starts mailing photographs of the lonely, unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims, challenging spader, along with the chicago police department, to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again. 
 in the midst of this murderous frenzy, there 's spader 's psychologist, played by marisa tomei, who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in"" the cell. 
"" 
 writers david elliot, clay ayers and darcy meyers, along with first- time director joe charbanic( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar), dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase, revealing, early on, exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop"" need each other to give meaning to our lives. 
"" 
 plus, as reeves explains,"" we 're all stacked right on top of each other, but we do n't notice each other any more. 
"" after that, it 's all sound effects and tricky camera- work, along with a muddled, discordant soundtrack. 
 james spader 's acting technique can be described as' wooden deadpan' while keanu reeves maintains his perpetually monotone' dude' persona which sometimes works, sometimes does n't. 
 chris ellis, as spader 's self- important colleague, is the only cast member who manages to be convincing.

" virus"" is the type of cliched, vacuous film that has been recylcled so many times before that you wonder why anyone would even bother putting work into making it. 
 strangely enough, on the same mid- january weekend last year, another film was released like this,"" deep rising,"" about an ugly monster on a cruise liner.

"" virus,"" in comparison, is a servicable thriller, well- made and produced, but since it does n't include one moment of even remote originality or intelligence, 
 it sinks under the weight of the water that the film was shot on. 
 based on a series of comic books,"" virus"" concerns the crew of an ocean salvage tugboat, which becomes extremely damaged during a violent typhoon. 
 after discovering that the boat is slowly sinking,( un) lucky for them, a huge ocean vessel that appears to be dead in the water turns up within the confines of their radar screen. 
 once the team reaches the russian ship, they go on board to find that the place is seemingly deserted. 
 after turning the power back on, however, there gradually are signs that something else is on the ship, and the electrical equipment is oddly working by itself. 
 one survivor finally does turn up, nadia( joanna pacula), who informs the suicidal and stern captain( donald sutherland) and one of the crew, kit foster( jamie lee curtis), that a mysterious alien life form hit the santi mir space station which then was transported down to the ship, taking over the minds of all of the electrical machines and thinking that humans are viruses that should be completely wiped out.

 anyhow, stephen approaches david with an interesting proposition: he 'll pay him to kill his lovely wife. 
 mortensen agrees, but the murder goes awry, and the twists keep on coming as the film progresses.

 the plot moves nowhere fast, and only becomes exciting in very short bursts. 
 not too good for a' thriller.' 
 also, the performances, apart from douglas, are below par. 
 paltrow, showing immense talent in se7en( 1995) and sliding doors( 1997) is strangely stilted, even unconvincing, in this movie. 
 mortensen is a little bit better, coming across as a younger douglas, but his role is n't meaty enough to show all his talent. which leaves douglas to waltz away with the film, which is does.

"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers, relentless, 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz, played by character actor leo rossi, spawned three more sequels. relentless 3, third in the row, features sam dietz again, but this time detective, who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case, does n't want to deal with similar line of work. 
 divorced, demoralised and transferred, he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer, and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz 's old cases. 
 to make things even more interesting, it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation. 
 fans of the british tv films and mini- series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies. 
 they both feature vicious psychopathic killers, yet also give a lot of, usually depressive, details about chief investigator 's private lives.

"edward burns tackles his third picture with no looking back, and like his previous two, it is a working- class relationship picture. 
 however, unlike his previous work, the film dwells on a more personal story, and with a female protagonist. 
 and in no looking back, he stumbles, making a slow, boring film without the spark that enlivened his previous work. 
 claudia( lauren holly) is a small town waitress who is feeling stifled by her life.

"i do n't expect much from eddie murphy these days. 
 for the past four years, the gods of cinema -- or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates -- have allowed him to make one bad movie after another. 
 such films as metro, doctor dolittle, holy man, life, and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed- up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures. 
 the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film, nutty professor ii: the klumps. 
 the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump, an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places. 
 sherman has just invented a new"" youth drink"" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time. 
 janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor( and for the most ridiculous reasons). 
 with love on his mind, sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego, buddy love from the first professor, who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers. 
 with some convoluted mumbo- jumbo about dna extraction, sherman extracts the"" buddy love"" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy- dandy lab beaker. 
 but one night, the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated... 
 because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy. 
 then the klump family, all played by eddie murphy, step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex, flabby breasts, a slew of fart and dick jokes, and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes.

 an assassination takes place, and santaro tries to peace together how it took place, trying to work out the roles of the people involved in this conspiracy.

"tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie. 
 the film( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage, and, while it 's evident that this could be a fascinating live production, the translation to the screen is a creative disaster. 
 enduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious. 
 the qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium. 
 tectonic plates has a storyline, although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non- traditional fashion, with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences. 
 it 's not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious, all- but- screaming,"" look! art!""), although it keeps the audience distanced from the characters. 
 because we 're constantly made aware that we 're watching a play or a movie, it 's impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer 's ideas.

"a documentary from the twin hughes brothers, allen and albert( dead presidents, menace ii society), about street pimps, all of whom are african- american.

 it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho 's, and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be, is what you get. 
 i learned that the word"" bitch"" is their favorite word, as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used. 
 it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say, but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about, then some of what they rap about might seem amusing. 
 they seem to all want to be thought of as businessmen, in the business because it is the easiest way for them to make big money. 
 it 's also a power trip, accomplished by manipulating the girls to work for them, mostly by humiliating them and keeping them in place. 
 this sleazy pic, soon became grating and wore out its welcome to my unreceptive ears. 
 these verbose pimps had a smart answer for everything and never knew when to shut their face.

 while this may be of interest to his hard core fans, there 's little about green 's mania on display here to recommend this movie to anyone else.

"another formula' feel good' quirky comedy from the british isles, much like"" waking ned devine,"" and a host of other popular low budget movies that turned a nifty profit off a thin story line. 
 it is filled with likable establishment types living in a quaint town, such as tolerant vicars and policemen, plenty of eccentrics, and of locals who stick together through thick and thin. 
 the strength of this film lies in its rational theme, that smoking pot should be legalized since it is even less dangerous than drinking alcohol. 
 the film is tolerable until after its first hour, it then falls completely apart, becoming just too absurd to consider as anything but 
 sitcom fluff gone completely bananas. 
 but its long overdue message of decriminalization for certain drugs is on target and allows the film to, at least, be viewed as containing a pertinent message. 
 its message is especially appropriate nowadays considering the' war on drugs' 
 is about to be escalated into colombia. 
 the drug war has been a total failure so far and with no hope of it being won by law enforcement methods in the future, it has so far just ended up causing america 's jails to be overcrowded with non- violent drug prisoners and offers zero hope of curtailing america 's drug usage and drug supply. 
 billions of dollars have just been allocated by congress to get officially involved in the colombian civil war, by backing a corrupt government( remember vietnam!) 
 with the idea that military might could stop the cocaine and marijuana harvests in that country. 
 everything about this proposed action smacks of vietnam, with this scenario closer to home, so 
 what probably awaits such an effort is a more futile result than the other war. 
 the film 's mild theme of showing squares getting into the weed business and finding it acceptable by the public, something that should have been accepted some 40 years ago, is a theme long overdue for public acceptance, but one that is better received late than never.

" love to kill"" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes. 
 at the outset, the movie appears to be about tony danza, who 's an illegal distributor of guns, trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman. 
 danza sets up a double date with her, her sister, and a collegue of his. 
 everything seems to be going well, until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs. 
 much confusion and mahem ensues, as the death is covered up and other associates of danza 's begin to emerge, all after one thing or another. 
 sound confusing? 
 it is. 
 i think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity. 
 in some respects, it works. 
 but the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess. 
 characters keep popping up with no explanation, demanding money for deals that occur off- screen. 
 the only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman 's sister. 
 but so little time is devoted to this part of the story, we never really become too familiar with these characters, and because of this, we do n't really care what happens to them. 
 well, i did n't, at least. 
 one thing i will give the movie is that it 's a complete departure for tony danza. 
 here 's a guy, because of his many sitcom roles, who 's ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing. 
 here, he plays a man who 's just looking out for himself, and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin, so be it.

 but it does n't really make much of a difference. 
 deep impact begins the official summer movie season, and it also brings back memories of 1997. 
 remember when dante 's peak came out in february? 
 a few months later, volcano was released. 
 the first film was smart, exhilirating, and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen. 
 the latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent.

 this time, unfortunately, the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon, the upcoming comet- disaster to be released the beginning of july. 
 of course, the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine, and so i am in the minority, as i was when i stood on the side of dante 's peak.

 although in one sense it may seem tedious, making a movie about the ugliness of greed( not box office material), it does become tedious, not because of the morale ending, but because one expects the movie to end that way.

" practical magic,"" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high- profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap- trap like this one. 
 the film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens, two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches, spanning back 200 years. 
 at the start, their parents die when they are still children, and they go to live with their two zany aunts( stockard channing and dianne wiest). 
 switch to the present day, gillian, who is the stronger, more rebellious sibling, leaves home, and meets up with a dark, abusive guy( goran visjnic), while sally stays in their hometown, meets and falls in love with a sweet, caring man, has two children, and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed( come to think of it, she 's not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes). 
 when gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic, they accidentally murder him, and in desperation, bury the body in the backyard of their aunts' house. 
 add to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism, not to mention a spattering of"" light- hearted whimsy,"" and you have a pretty good idea how messy 
"" practical magic"" is.

 andrew kevin walker 's screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story"" the legend of sleepy hollow.

 ichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders. 
 several of the town 's leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman. 
 although he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him, ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning. 
 he also discovers that the killings are not random, that the victims are tied together by a secret. 
 along the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching( literally) young woman( christina ricci) and the son of one of the murder victims( marc pickering). 
 my reaction: ho- hum

 the plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting.

 i was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science- fiction flick species. 
 squandering an intriguing premise, the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess, widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success, raking in over$ 60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast( ben kingsley 's a splendid actor, but 
 a marquee name he ai n't). 
 miraculously dodging the bullet with the first film, i doubted that they 'd dare tempt fate and go for another round. 
 so here comes species ii, with a new creative team( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman, respectively) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor, species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid. 
 the film follows the exploits of a young man, patrick ross( justin lazard), whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women, loitering in strip clubs, and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can. 
 in other words, patrick is like a lot of guys; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age, but there 's a catch -- he 's an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars, and who 's now infected with alien dna.

"the sequel to the fugitive( 1993), u. s

 tommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard, the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive. 
 this time, he 's after fugitive mark sheridan( snipes) who the police think killed two fbi agents, but of course he 's been set up, and when the police plane escort he( and gerard) are riding crashes, he makes a run for it, gerard not so hot on his tail. 
 what follows is about 2 hours of action, brought to us by the director of executive decision( 1995),

 when comparing this movie to the fugitive, the prequel is far superior. 
 but even on it 's own, u. s 
 marshals is a pretty lousy movie. 
 while the original was reasonably intelligent, and had a fugitive to root for, the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive, mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film 's overlong running time.

 marshals is straight in there, pulling it 's trump card( the place crash) almost immediately.

"" switchback"" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she 's watching. 
 we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse( dennis quaid), and that the kidnapper/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while.

 lacrosse 's most recent trek takes him to a blood- soaked hotel room in amarillo, texas, where the local sheriff( r. lee ermey) is torn between his re- election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man. 
 in a related aside, former railway worker bob goodall( danny glover) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup- plastered( even on the seatbelts) el dorado. 
 along the way, he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon( jared leto).

 in the year 2176, there are 640, 000 earthlings on mars, living in a matriarchal society led by a commander, played by pam grier.

 that 's ice cube- to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder. 
 but when they 're besieged by demented, zombie- like, body- snatching miners, they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection. 
 it seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and, soon after, most of the miners went bonkers as long- dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies, lopping off heads as"" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet,"" according to a scientist( joanna cassidy).

"the ads for"" batman and robin"" scream"" the event of the summer is here"" and that 's the problem. 
 the producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it. 
"" batman and robin"" is 126 minutes of lavish sets, flashy costumes and big, confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance. 
 it 's like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows; bright, busy and visually diverting, but not very much fun. 
 it was n't always this way. 
 tim burton 's"" batman"" was an epic story of obsession and duality, of darkness and revenge. 
 the film, while far from perfect, was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel. 
 batman was a creepy, brooding creature of the night. 
 the joker, brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson, was at once charismatic and repellent. 
 batman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin, battling inner demons and one another over gotham city 's breathtaking gothic skyline. 
 those days of the dark knight are gone, replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck. 
"" batman and robin"" has far more in common with the campy 60 's batman tv show than with tim burton 's tale of darkness. 
 the blame lies with director joel schumacher. 
 a former window- dresser, schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes. 
 unfortunately, when it comes time to have those people walk and talk, he has n't the faintest notion of what to do. 
"" batman and robin"" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it 's often difficult to tell who 's whacking who. 
 while the characters flail at each other, one- liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti. 
 a few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing, but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film.

" gordy"" is not a movie, it is a 90-minute- long"" sesame street"" skit, and a very bad one at that. 
 this movie is so stupid and dumb that it 's depressing to think that some hollywood executives actually gave this the green light, and even more surprising is the fact that this is a disney movie. 
 i 'm sure children are the target audience of this movie, but only kids under the age of five may be able to tolerate it. 
 it is the story of a farm a piglet named gordy( voiced by garms), whose family has been taken away to"" up north,"" which we know means death. 
 of course we can hear the animals talk to each other, and they actually went to the trouble of attempting to sync the voices with their mouths but 
 it comes out terrible. 
 actually, it 's almost funny in a way. 
 the only remotely interesting and likable character soon appears, a little girl named jinnie sue macallister( young) who sees gordy on the back of a truck and essentially steals him. 
 jinnie is a country singer and the film goes off on a huge tangent to show her little concert and the people dancing to it. 
 what is the point of this? 
 maybe she is one of the producer 's relatives and they wanted to show her on camera to promote her or something. 
 we then cut to a huge social gathering and drop in on another young kid named hank royce( roescher) who is sad because his divorced mother is dating. 
 he leaves the party and meets jinnie sue, but he accidentally falls in a pool( probably because he was sitting on the diving board with a$ 200 suit on- nah, did n't see that one coming!), starts to drown, and is miraculously saved as gordy pushes an inflatable float over to him and saves him.

"senseless 
( r) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian, and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life. 
 alas, moments are simply 
 that, moments, which are not enough to lift this fantasy/ comedy above its one- joke premise. granted, that one joke is initially amusing. 
 when wayans 's darryl witherspoon, an economics major at stratford university, hits some dire financial straits, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses. 
 after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses, darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm. 
 at this point, the film sounds more like senseful than senseless, but through some turns of the plot, darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once, essentially leaving him -- yes -- senseless. 
 this sets up some showcase moments for wayans 's gift for physical comedy, especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely, hilariously limp. but these gags, and the gag behind the entire movie, 
 quickly grows stale. 
 once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses, instead of exploring any new comic territory, director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin 
 take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness. 
 wayans approaches each go- round with gusto, but by this point he 's simply treading water for the rest of the film 's unfunny duration. 
 senseless would not be as problematic as it is if it did n't strive to be anything more than a comic trifle. 
 however, the raucous and often raunchy comedy is wrapped in a blanket of bogus sincerity. 
 darryl goes through the experiment in order to help his cash- strapped family, and this"" serious"" angle seems to come from an entirely different movie.

"deceiver is a plot twist in search of a movie. 
 this overly constructed film succeeds in having many surprises, and, being true to its title, being deceptive. 
 but there is little in the film that is worthy of deceit. 
 braxton( chris penn) and kennesaw( michael rooker) 
 are two cops investigating the brutal murder of a prostitute( renee zellweger). 
 their lone suspect is wayland( tim roth), a wealthy young man whose phone number was found in the hooker 's pocket. 
 however, a routine lie detector test turns against the investigators, as the crafty wayland somehow turns the tables. 
 braxton and kennesaw are forced to confront their own troubled lives. 
 braxton is a gambling addict in deep to mook( ellen burstyn), a local bookie. 
 kennesaw is bitter about his marriage to a socialite( rosanna arquette), believing his wife to be unfaithful. 
 the plot is twisty and complex, with lots of lengthy flashbacks, and plenty of surprises. 
 however, there are times when it is needlessly complex, and at least one instance 
 the storytelling turns so muddled that the answers to important plot points actually get lost. 
 take a look at l. a. confidential, or the film 's more likely inspiration, the usual suspects for how a complex plot can properly be handled. 
 the dialogue in deceiver is as overcrafted as the plot.

 there 's never the sense that these are real characters engaging in conversation. 
 they appear to be nothing more than words on a screenplay.

"this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney 's live- action george of the jungle. 
 tarzan and the lost city, the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough 's legendary hero to the big screen, is one of the most inept and ill- timed of any tarzan adventure so far. 
 badly conceived and poorly executed, tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves. 
 i have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan; it 's not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie. 
 furthermore, it 's even more curious that this film is rated pg, which, by definition, rules out any sex or explicit violence. 
 and, while i 'm not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story, tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production. 
 of course, no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city, since the film 's troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line 
. 
 imagine george of the jungle stripped of all( intentional) humor, and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like.

 even worse, the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe( michael keaton), currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society. 
 connor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery; he 's at first reluctant, but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital. 
 when he does make a run for it, connor offers close pursuit, but for different reasons than his superiors( including the crusty brian cox) -- they want to take mccabe down, while connor needs to keep him alive, or all hope is lost for his little boy. 
 one misstep"" desperate measures"" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt 's illness. 
 what 's needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country, and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow.

"maybe this mission should have been scrubbed mission to mars a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman 
 there 's a world of difference between artists and technicians. 
 the artist has a vision to create something new. 
 he may not do it well 
, it might be sloppy, but it 's something you 've never seen before. 
 a good technician can make it look good, but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else, it 's going to be just a xerox. 
 obviously successful films need both skills. 
 brian de palma is a masterful technician. 
 he 's spent his career copying others, most notably hitchcock. 
 he usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work, but only because he has learned it by rote. aside from rare flashes of originality, his films are often soul- dead. 
 in de palma 's latest, he turns his attention to stanley kubrick. 
 to tell the truth, i enjoyed portions of this movie, but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called"" 2001"". 
 i enjoyed it even more when it was titled"" close encounters"". 
 nasa has set its sights for mars. 
 when the first crew meets with disaster, a rescue mission is sent to the red planet. 
 they do n't do so well either, but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut- gone- rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe. 
 and it 's all so boring. 
 there are so many scenes that just do n't work, it 's difficult to begin. 
 when the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside- down martian tornado( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from"" dune"") destroying everything in its path, they just hang out watching.

"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival. 
 as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival. 
 it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time 
. 
 in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry. 
 toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart. 
 the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot 
 and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it. 
 something else is what he did. 
 the film opens with a woman( played by laura harring) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life. 
 she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep. 
 meanwhile young vivacious betty( naomi watts) arrives in hollywood from canada. 
 she wants to build a career as an actress. 
 betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow. 
 she does not know who the woman is. 
 she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is. 
 they fix on a name rita for her, but are not sure if this right or not. 
 meanwhile local director adam kesher( justin theroux) has problems of his own. 
 he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else, cammie rhodes( melissa george). 
 these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong. 
 there is also a strange character called the cowboy( monty montgomery) adding to the confusion.

 basically, chucky is a plastic doll that can walk and talk because it is possessed by the spirit of a slain murderer. 
 in bride of chucky, chucky 's longtime girlfriend tiffany( jennifer tilly) 
 dies and her spirit inhabits a female plastic doll through voodoo. 
 dolls tiffany and chucky get married and embark on a quest to reach a cemetery in new jersey, where a mystical gem might enable them to be humans. 
 the dolls stow away in the back of a vehicle driven by a newly eloped couple, so in the side plot, the couple suspects each other of being a murderer. 
 opinion: bride of chucky is an attempt at horror with humor, but does n't succeed. 
 somehow, chucky moaning about mid life crisis, and how he should have gotten married does not make for a very scary chucky. and tiffany harping about mid life crisis, and how she should have gotten married does not make for a very scary tiffany. 
 the suspenseless bride of chucky relies mostly on jennifer tilly 's cleavage to keep attention during the first half, and on occasional puns to keep attention during the second half. 
 the best that can be said about bride of chucky is that it is sarcastic.

"watching the movie, i vowed to subtract half a star from the review because the filmmakers included a saccharine syrup, cute' n 
 cuddly, computer- generated monkey. 
 if the monkey died, the movie got an extra half star. 
 alas, the monkey showed up at the end, unharmed, to the wet sickly sound of gagging and rolling eyeballs.

 that 's pretty generous, considering the movie 's camp lacked any hint of tongue in cheek

 when will robinson( jack johnson) teaches his pet robot about friendship, you are actually supposed to buy it. 
 so why such a seemingly high rating? 
 there are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage. 
 first, we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater. 
 the sound and screen kicked ass. 
 nobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did( and i do n't necessarily mean that in a good way). 
 also, there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons, or getting caught up in the movie 's tension. 
 i even liked the computer- generated settings. 
 i usually prefer to see models or sets, but the cg was more detailed than i 've seen in a lot of movies; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities. 
 also, gary oldman is never a bad actor, even though he is typecast as a villain. 
 william hurt is n't too bad either. 
 neither actor had a great role, but their performances were watchable. 
 and perhaps i should n't admit this, but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood.

"starship troopers is a bad movie. 
 i mean, a really, really, bad movie. 
 not only does it cross the line of bad taste

 christopher lambert plays a computer- parts salesman who 's on business in japan. 
 he meets a slinky young woman( joan chen) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader( john lone).

 in this movie, the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him. 
 i imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body. 
 you know what a goof field is: that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is.

 capsule review: a question: after the floating baby ruth that was waterworld, what in the @$&% were the hollywood execs who gave kevin costner the money to make another post- apocalyptic movie thinking? 
 in this 3 hour advertisement for his new hair weave, costner plays a nameless drifter who dons a long dead postal employee 's uniform and gradually turns a nuked- out usa into an idealized hippy- dippy society.

"starring ben stiller, elizabeth hurley, maria bello, janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz, based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz permanent midnight is a pretty bad movie, though it took me a few days to conclude this. 
 the film is more masturbatory than bleak, with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity. 
( he has a$ 6000 a week drug habit.) 
 ultimately, as adapted by veloz, jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve; you are less mystified by his self- destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself. 
 ben stiller plays stahl, a young author who arrives in l. a. with ambition and a nasty drug habit.

 chompers( a thinly veiled stand- in for"" alf"": 
 chompers looks just like alf except he 's blue), marries a producer( hurley) so she can get a green card, and hooks up with a spanish mother( liz torres), who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons. 
 insert proverbial downward spiral here. 
 permanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback, with recovering addict bello meeting stiller( at a fastfood restaurant, where stiller works the drive- thru as part of rehab), taking him back to a hotel, and between bouts of serious screwing, listening to his life story.

 as stahl, stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect 
( post- there 's something about mary) of either the actor or a comedy writer.

 the prison scenes are accompanied by voice- overs in which poe, in a languid southern drawl, describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met.

 cage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim- witted and ridiculous, and that he 's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained.

 in the rock, cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time.

" 
 the animal"" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along, generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling. 
 it 's clunky and slow, like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill. 
 there are certainly better things you can do with your time. 
 actually, if you 've seen the trailer, then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments. 
 the story centers on bland marvin( rob schneider), who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer. 
 but he 's afflicted with loser- itis. 
 dogs attack him 
, neighbors torment him, children bully him, and his co- workers ignore him. 
 truthfully, with his bad haircut( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic, little richard, and giant poodles) and his unenthusiastic demeanor, we 'd probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun. 
 this is actually bad because you ca n't like a character if you ca n't develop sympathy for him. 
 we never do, and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor. 
 however, marvin is found by an eccentric doctor( michael caton) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him, implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs. 
 as a result, marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed. 
 he can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body, swim with the speed of a dolphin, and can run as fast as a cheetah. 
 imagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation. 
 with his enhanced abilities, he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him. 
 however, the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn, and instead, marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic, sexual urges. 
 goats beware! 
 he also chases cats, urinates to mark his territory, or growls at his enemies.

"romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant. 
 with director peter medak, whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays, and top- notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin, they seemed likely to be a successful combination. 
 those mentioned films, however, brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding 
 did not: a solid, well- written screenplay. 
 call me cynical, but the jobs of writer and producer do n't seem to mix well. 
 gary oldman plays jack grimaldi, a good cop turned bad, selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife. 
 his cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname, although the name does n't provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character. 
 jack has become addicted to"" feeding the hole"", a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money.

 in the process, he also gets tangled- up with mona demarkov, a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone, played adequately by roy scheider. 
 demarkov, played by lena olin, is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world. 
 this character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2.

 after being shot, handcuffed, and thrown in the back seat of a car, she still manages to cause an accident, kick out the windshield with her legs, grab a suitcase full of money( plus some important documentation), climb through the rubble, land on her shot leg, and still succeed at running for safety.

 there is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth, nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight.

 54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name, which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s. 
 i do n't know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released, but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson 's brilliant work in every possible way, from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography. 
 what it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great: depth, intelligence, energy, fascinating characters, and challenging themes. 
 54 ca n't even measure up to the last days of disco, which is flawed, but still smart and entertaining. 
 it 's remarkably bad timing, i 'd say, to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind. 
 i have exaggerated, though: there is one interesting character, and one terrific performance. 
 that character is steve rubell, played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves.

 personally, i 'm hoping americans everywhere will rise to the occasion and make young einstein a box office bomb. 
 young einstein sprang from the twisted mind of yahoo serious, who not only wrote, produced, edited, and directed the film, but also starred and did his own stunts.

"capsule: 
 the much anticipated re- adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting, but very little intelligence. 
 visually there is much to like about this version, but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver 's travels and treat it as an action film. 
 that makes it a film without much center., 0( -4 to +4) 
 pierre boulle, author of the bridge on the river kwai, wrote planet of the apes( a. k. a. monkey planet), the novel, as a social satire. 
 it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver 's travels. 
 humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed, not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift 's island of the houyhnhnms. 
 the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet. 
 it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals, but perhaps i was just looking for that. 
 when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968, he added a number of serling touches, familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling- ish. 
 the final irony of the original version has become film history. 
 without it there could never have been a"" planet of the apes"" film series. 
 i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language. 
 in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language. 
 that could have been done in the film, but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non- ape- speaking. 
 serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and, of course, there is some justification for that by the end of the film. 
 justifying why",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the film for its lack of intelligence and its approach to treat an adventure story as an action film. The reviewer also points out issues with the script and the handling of language in the film.,0.16481805316000625

 it 's just like that. 
 anyway, part 3 takes place a day after the events of part 2( so technically still 1985). 
 this time, a group of horny teens( who also bring along two aging hippie potheads for some reason) head up to a cabin on crystal lake for a weekend of sex and weed.

"jessica lange is one of the most inconsistent actresses working today. 
 from time- to- time, she blows away audiences with powerful, intense performances. 
 on the other hand, this is the same woman who made her jaw- droppingly awful feature debut in dino delaurentiis' king kong. 
 and, much as lange would probably prefer movie- goers to develop amnesia regarding that particular entry on her resume, every once in a while she does work that is reminiscent of it, if only in quality. 
 hush is one such example. 
 lange is so bad here that she might have been fun to watch if the rest of the film was n't such a prime example of motion picture tedium. 
 the film opens, as many so- called"" psychological thrillers"" do, by posing as a light drama. 
 we are introduced to jackson( johnathon schaech, last encounter in tom hanks' that thing you do!) 
 and helen( gwyneth paltrow), a picture perfect young couple who are very much in love. 
 jackson is taking helen home for the holidays so she can meet his mother, martha( lange).

 soon, the wicked witch of the east is plotting a way for her son to get helen pregnant( this involves poking a hole in a diaphragm). 
 once that goal is accomplished, she manipulates events so that the expecting couple moves out of new york city to the horse farm where she lives. as long as she gets her way, martha is a perfectly amicable person, but when helen defies her, it 's a declaration of war.

 is a rich, childish, angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa( kristy swanson). 
 in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin( jon stewart) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian( cole and dylan sprouse) while kevin is on an overseas trip.

 meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk, food, toys, and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform. 
 not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny 's incompetent supervision, and this leads to a custody battle.

 watching glen or glenda? 
 i found myself occasionally wondering if wood had originally made two or three separate movies and accidentally edited them together; as a result, it is actually quite entertaining in that

 the movie starts out as what mostly seems like a bad documentary, with endless, repetitive narration about transvestites, how difficult it is for a transvestite to look at his girlfriend 's clothes without being able to wear them, how transvestites are not necessarily homosexuals, and how the main character, glen/ glenda is( as it reminds us probably half a dozen times)"" not half man and half woman, but man and woman at the same time.

"this is my first review that i post to this newsgroup, and i kind of feel like i have to say something negative about this film. 
 no one else seems to care that it takes certain liberties that should not be taken with a historical story. 
 however, even if one thinks of it as fiction,"" the prince of egypt"" remains shallow. 
 but i 'll begin from the beginning. 
 the biggest difference between the original, biblical story and this version is that moses has some semblance of divinity in the bible, whereas the animated version gives the impression of a reluctant hero. 
 maybe it 's just me, but 
 if i knew i had god on my side, i 'd have a little bit more confidence. 
 there are other differences as well, such as a lack of important female characters and the passing over of the original pharoah 's death like it 's nothing but a thing. 
 most of all, though, the story 's focus has shifted. rather than being a story about father- son, man- ethnicity, man- god,"" the prince of egypt"" is almost solely about the brother- brother relationship between rameses and moses. 
 i was originally excited about this story element until i saw the movie, where it came off as maudlin.

"last summer, a feature- length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning. 
 based on the famous 60 's television show, the film was an enormous box- office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros. 
 a year later, the studio is up to their old tricks again, with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild, wild west.

 and co- star kevin kline is attached to the project, as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects. 
 i mean, what could possibly go wrong? 
 the answer is just about everything. 
 wild wild west is a cinematic abomination- a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate

 there are a lot of fancy special effects, and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression.

 at square one, we have a bizarre case of casting. 
 will smith plays james west, a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series. 
 my guess regarding the casting of african- american smith is a simple one: the actor+ a cozy summertime release= big bucks for all those involved.

 swordfish is loud, violent and amoral. 
 it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life. 
 and how does travolta 's gabriel plan to do this? 
 by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out- terrorize terrorists. 
 swordfish is a very cynical movie. 
 it relies on an audience 's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non- human, faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration.

 after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert, catharine has no success to report.

"synopsis: 
 an aging master art thief, his supplier, and a young, buxom security consultant are all not who they first appear to be( or are they?) in this convoluted mess involving a risky heist during the millennium. 
 comments: 
 this movie was boring. 
 plain and simple. 
 entrapment should not have been boring. 
 it stars sean connery, who can still carry an action film despite his age, catherine zeta- jones, a likeable enough film presence, and ving rhames, ultra- cool star of pulp fiction and mission: impossible. 
 it takes full advantage of the y2k computer bug fears( a current"" hot topic"" in the news) in its storyline, which is set at the end of 1999. 
 it has some genuinely well- staged action sequences. 
 so, what went wrong? 
 plenty, unfortunately. 
 the major problem with entrapment is its script. 
 it has a been- there, done- that feel to it. 
 nothing seems particularly inventive or original, so the whole movie lacks suspense and drags 
( it runs nearly two hours). 
 the screenwriters, for example, periodically use a countdown to the millennium as a means of transition between scenes( i. 
 e. 
"" 
 4 days to the millennium""). 
 this device was used much more effectively in the overlooked sci- fi film strange days. 
 the characters are not who they appear to be at the beginning, which is neat at first but the device wears thin once the umpteenth"" surprise"" revelation is made. entrapment, in other words, relies too heavily on the audience not knowing what each character 's true motive is, resulting in a convoluted story which leaves many scratching their heads in confusion. 
 the star power here is quite strong, but the viewer ca n't help but feel the actors are wasted in this production.

 the facial features are more detailed than any computer- animation seen to date, but the result is more reminiscent of a very well- crafted doll than anything human.

 alicia silverstone is completely wasted playing jennifer, the babysitter. 
 her character has absolutely no depth at all, and her sole purpose in the movie is to be the object of the other characters' fantasies.

"there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been. 
 the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944, where a one- time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets, fists stuffed into coat pockets. 
 to one side of him, residents scavenge for food in the street; to the other side, german troops beat a group of jews. 
 jakob, however, never stops moving. 
 it 's an efficient, effective set- up for the character, who is clearly nobody 's idea of a hero at the outset. 
 he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them, excising his moral peripheral vision. 
 the set- up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior. 
 after a visit to a german commandant 's office and a moment alone with a turned- on radio, jakob learns that russian troops are quite near. 
 when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews, they become convinced that he must have a radio, which is a punishable offense in the ghetto. 
 the good news brings hope to the ghetto; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes.

 from the writer/ director of"" blue velvet"" and"" twin peaks"" comes another dark, mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive, the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills. 
 dazed, a beautiful brunette( laura elena harring) emerges and stumbles down a hill, slipping unobserved into a' 30s- style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip. 
 the next morning, a dewy blonde( naomi watts) from deep river, ontario, arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase. 
 her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet. 
 the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust. 
 meanwhile, a hotshot director( justin theroux), whose wife is in bed with the poolman, is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there 's an assassin( mark pellegrino) roaming the city. 
 the tortuous paths of these various characters- and others named cookie, coco and cowboy- intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because, midway through the story, lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality, leaving a huge wad of cash, a blue metallic key, a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered

" mercury rising"" has numerous flaws, but there is one that really stands out: its central plot device is unnecessary. 
 that 's right. 
 the major aspect of the film, that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy/ action flicks could be dropped from the beginning, and the movie would turn out exactly the same, if not better. 
 this central device is the fact that a nine- year- old boy is autistic. 
 his name is simon, and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow( alec baldwin) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it. 
 simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film, and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent, unfair world against his will, with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him. 
 the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of"" mercury rising. 
"" 
 i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon 's character and his relationship with willis, but here it is lost.

 it 's a trend not a movie- is spawn, and if you 've seen the animated series on hbo you 'll recall it embodies the lost life of a disfigured man, an individual who has transpired the ultimate punishment: he 's been sent to hell. 
 todd mcfarlane, the creator of the spawn comic book, must have had a tough time sitting through spawn, for his creativity and themes about resurrection and loss of identity were all being jettisoned in favor of reliable special effects, style over substance, ambience over anything else. 
 not only does spawn rely entirely on special effects, the story, about a bewildered individual who must take on a group of* bad guys* and* find himself* in the process is realized in such a sordid, incapable manner, it becomes indigestible after a while. 
 every character in this film is lifeless, vacuous and seemingly written by a depressed college student. 
 the story begins, like in every superhero movie in this age, with a man living an idyllic life. 
 al simmons( michael jai white), a government agent/ assassin shares the love of his wife, wanda( theresa russell) and daughter, has a tongue- in- cheek, wiseass partner, terry( d. b sweeney) and is content with the job his boss, jason wynn( martin sheen), provides him. 
 the next element in the film is the part when things go awry. 
 and as expected, everyone turns the tables on poor al. 
 as the two are investigating their latest mission at some sort of biological weapons plant, al is befriended by jason, and dies in a gory and truly sickening",negative,"The review criticizes ""Spawn"" for relying entirely on special effects and having a sordid, incapable storyline.

"it 's not a bad thing to update old stories. 
 it 's done all the time in the oral tradition. 
 the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed, it 's that it 's dry. 
 the new cinderella, danielle( drew barrymore) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come. 
 she 's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france. 
 when her father dies, she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla( anjelica huston).

 danielle meets prince henry( dougray scott), goes to a ball disguised, is later found out and they live happily ever after. 
 the movie is often like watching a filmed play.

 theater on the screen is usually lifeless. 
 there does n't seem to be much going on. 
 the camera can be a star of films. 
 here it 's a 
 co- conspirator. 
 danielle 's convictions are compromised. 
 a socialist and a feminist, she pretends to be royalty to get her man. 
 a kind woman, her last act in the movie is one of revenge. 
 the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish. 
 the fairy godmother stand- in, leonardo da vinci( patrick godfrey) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle. 
 huston is enjoyable in her over- the- top wickedness.

"i suppose it 's unfair to criticize a movie like hudson hawk, which has been panned by reviewers and moviegoers alike since it 's 1991 release. 
 michael lehmann 's action- comedy was quick to win the title` biggest box office flop of all time', or close thereof. 
 the movie stars bruce willis as renowned cat burglar hudson hawk, who 's just been released from sing sing prison after many years in isolation(` let me put it this way,' he explains,` i never saw et'). 
 greeting him is his old friend and partner in crime( played by danny aiello), who becomes the subject of many amusing fat jokes. 
 these are rather welcome in a movie filled with so many completely unfunny sight gags, cartoonish villains and unbelievable coincidences. 
 it appears as if director lehmann did n't know when to stop all the absurd silliness, and 
 he piles on layer after layer of utter ridiculousness 
 as the movie propels itself toward the finish line. 
 if at some point during hudson hawk you make the assumption that things could n't get goofier, you 'll soon be eating your words. 
 but, i 'm inclined to say that this film is not quite as terrible as it 's box office numbers suggest. 
 it 's fast- paced and entertaining, if you 've got incredible patience and a warped sense of humor. 
 for the first portion of this review, i 'm going to try and center on the positive aspects of hudson hawk. 
 wish me luck. 
 first and foremost: bruce willis is a good sport. 
 while i 'm not entirely sure what he was smoking when he co- wrote this script, willis is quite aware that the entire project is a big, fat, ugly joke. 
 he constantly gives deadpan reactions to things that are very silly and out- of- place, which means he has more than his share of deadpan reactions. 
 another plus is the appearance of andie macdowell as a schizophrenic nun and love interest for the title character.

"if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film, it was studio 54, the late steve rubell 's infamous new york discotheque, which came to symbolize the taboo- smashing excesses of the disco era 's heyday: easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone, all set to a thumping dance beat. 
 so when miramax started production on_ 54_ last year, the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began: an edgy film as down- and- dirty as the club itself, written and directed by a promising first- timer( mark christopher) and starring some hot young talent( salma hayek, neve campbell, newcomer ryan phillippe, and 
 mike myers in his dramatic debut). 
 my, how easily does the worm turn. 
 hype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th- hour reshoots

 unhappy, and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics.

"the spy game is up. 
 you can thank charlie 's angels -- the movie -- for that. 
 when did banality and pandering become okay? 
 just steal from hong kong, the matrix, and a kitschy tv show from the mid-1970s and that 's a movie? 
 charlie 's angels is one of the worst examples of action film homogeneity and shameless duplicity in any film i 've seen in ages. 
 charlie 's angels is dumb. 
 just plain dumb. 
 as we all know, three of the hottest females on the planet -- drew barrymore, cameron diaz, and lucy liu -- are three super- agents working for the mysterious millionaire named charlie. 
 they all drive fast cars, look oh- so- fabulous even in the morning, and do n't seem to get a scratch even when fighting armed men, having buildings explode ten feet in front of them, or flying through the air in matrix slow- motion. and while the entourage spends 90 minutes romping around in cleavage- busting wetsuits, cleavage- busting waitress uniforms, and cleavage- busting wet t- shirts, they scarcely succeed in resembling so much as a group of annoying, drunk sorority girls, the kind who hit on everybody at a party. 
 the actual plot revolves around the ridiculous story of a millionaire computer engineer -- the great sam rockwell -- who gets kidnapped by a mysterious rival computer company. 
 of course, the rival wants control of his new personal identification system, which involves such latter- day buzzwords as gps, cellular tracking, and even mainframe. 
 the amazing crispin glover lends his acting chops as a crazed henchmen involved in all the nasty things that happen to the angels -- like battling each of them in many round- robin matrix rip- off( again) fight sequences and harboring a strange attraction to sliced- off locks of the angels' hair. 
 the coup de grace is bill murray as bosley, serving as charlie 's manservant, or, more to the point, the angels' pimp.

"i have always been a fan of director neil jordan, from his early work, such as 1984 's"" the company of wolves,"" to 1992 's"" the crying game,"" and 1994 's"" interview with a vampire. 
"" 
 his latest film,"" the butcher boy,"" is a return to his roots in ireland, but unfortunately, it is not a successful homecoming 
. 
 told through the eyes of a 12-year- old irish boy, francis( newcomer eomann owens), this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life. 
 his father( stephen rea) is an indifferent alcoholic, his mother( fiona shaw) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals, and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore. 
 francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say, but 
 mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty, and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic, even capable of brutal murder. 
 the premise of,"" the butcher boy,"" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought- provoking, disturbing motion picture, but somehow nothing works 
. 
 francis is in almost every scene, but we learn very little about him, as if the film was distancing itself away from him when, i suspect, we were actually supposed to sympathize with him. 
 this is definately not young owens fault, however, because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance, and is able to also seem menacing as well. 
 the fact that we do n't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay. 
 the supporting characters are no help, though. 
 rea is wasted, and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son, or to anyone else for that matter. 
 he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout. 
 shaw has a little bit more to work with, since she has one touching",negative,"The review criticizes the movie for its unsuccessful execution despite the promising premise and talented cast.

"as you should know, this summer has been less than memorable. 
 with a total of 4 decent films, it 's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing. 
 with that said, you can pretty much predict what my opinion on"" the 13th warrior"" will be. 
 the film is based on the michael crichton"" eaters of the dead"", in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king. 
 after tarveling for many months, he comes across a gang of norsemen, who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog. 
 so, they start picking men, and are left without 1, thus ahmed is choosen. 
 so far it sounds interesting right? 
 not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes. 
 after that, they basically run around killing. 
 that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film, because once your story is introduced, you have the rest of the film to start developing it. 
 obviously that 's not the case here. 
 even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure, you will be disappointed. 
 since all the action takes place in fog, 
 it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances, and to poor camera work. 
 ca n't the camera men sit still? 
 i 'd like to actually watch a film in focus, but again, they failed to deliver that as well. 
 the film moves on and on until the point, where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you 're eating. 
 with corny dialogue, that the characters laugh at for some odd reason, a script that goes nowhere, dull action sequences, a predictable ending, and worst of all weak characters, there 's basically nothing to like here, except for maybe the set designs.

"the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits.

 the plot of 8 mm is similar to the 1977 paul schrader film hardcore, a surprisingly decent and engrossing tale. 
 in fact, it was everything that 8 mm is not. 
 in the opening minutes of 8 mm, we see private detective tom welles( nicolas cage) working on a case for a prestigious member of the u. s. government. 
 keep this fact in mind, cage is trusted with an important case, which he solves. 
 he returns home to his wife and new daughter, and even finds time to rake his yard 
( keep that in mind too, it 's important as well). 
 he 's hired by a rich elderly woman to solve a mystery. 
 after her husband 's death she comes across a film in his private safe. 
 it appears to be snuff film, a sort of urban legend of the pornography industry in which someone is actually brutally murdered for the camera. 
 the woman wants welles to locate the young girl in the film, hopefully to disprove that it is in fact a snuff film. 
 so he sets off on a journey into the sordid underworld of sleaze to discover the truth about the film. 
 the main problem with 8 mm is that the whole film is completely pointless.

 he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later, comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere. 
 now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back, ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying.

 where exactly is the point? 
 the film moves along at a rather slow pace, but does have one advantage: the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some. 
 it opens with a fun, innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that.

"the main problem with martin lawrence 's pet project, a thin line between love and hate, like any fatal attraction variation where the protagonist is a man, is that his character is an irresponsible jerk, and if that is the case, it does n't seem to do anything except justify the woman 's actions. 
 that is especially the case in lawrence 's darnell wright. 
 he is one of those macho guys with women lined up a mile long.

 my philosophy is, if you are one of the few heterosexual males lucky enough to get your hands on a beautiful, kind girl, you should treat her like a princess and respect her. 
 darnell does n't think like this. 
 he sleeps with these girls once and dumps them.

 for those uninformed souls, the mad slasher genre( or sub- genre) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline: a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween. 
 urban legend is a mad slasher flick, but one that is so sanitary, bloodless, and nudity free, that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful( though not overly talented) cast, it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special.

 if only. 
 in fact, the spy who shagged me is the exact opposite of the original; instead of refreshing the audience with one clever parody after another, 
 the filmmakers bombard us with used- up, tired jokes taken directly from the first one. take the scene where austin powers( again played by mike myers, but with only a fraction of the giddy enthusiasm he displayed previously) confronts a henchmen on the side of a cliff.

 he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle

"alexander dumas' the three musketeers is one of the most often- adapted literary works, and for good reason: the swashbuckler is a legend rather than just a story. 
 perhaps the musketeer, a new film that"" reimagines"" the novel in the spirit and style of the matrix, is one adaptation too many. 
 it 's just awful: spiritless, silly and unforgivably boring, transforming the timeless classic into a mish- mash of old- as- time clich? 
 s and incoherent, repetitive action sequences. 
 this time, d'artagnan is played by calvin klein model justin chambers, who ca n't even pronounce his character 's name. 
 as a boy, he watched his father get killed by febre( tim roth), a lackey of power- hungry cardinal richelieu. 
 he vowed to have vengeance. 
 after undergoing intense training under an expert swordsman, he goes looking for his enemy. 
 on his quest, he embroils himself in a struggle for control at the highest levels of the french government. 
 the royal musketeers have lost their gusto, what with their jobs being taken over by the cardinal 's own guards. 
 only a few loyal swashbuckers remain, among them athos and portos( who are only figureheads in this movie). together with d'artagnan, they fight to extricate the queen( catherine deneuve) from the traps that febre and richelieu are trying to plant. 
 oh, and as an afterthought, d'artagnan falls in love with the poor maid at the local inn( mena suvari).

"everyone knows that old rule,' never work with children and animals.' in this latest horror flick mimic case, it 's' never work with children and genetically enhanced killer animals' instead, as mimic features both of these and succeeds in doing nothing except mildly engaging the audience.

 it 's humans. 
 that should teach us for squishing all those bugs. 
 what should be a roller coaster ride with bugs everywhere, tons of gory deaths and some massive set pieces instead turns out to be a rather subdued, almost boring movie which plods along at a very slow pace. 
 perhaps the movie was trying to be thought provoking, and trying to avoid the' predator' type movie it could easily have become. 
 if it is, then the director and writers have made the wrong move, because this is perfectly suited to be an all out action fest.

 the only thing fox has to brag about. 
 disney 's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and to a lesser extent, hercules.

"here 's something to chew on: what 's the favorite food of big, cheesy- looking special effects monsters

 deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer. 
 in fact, considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas, perhaps it was. 
 the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore. 
 not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh( both human and non- human) been scattered in all directions. 
 we learn some bloody trivia, as well, such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains) and what it does with half- digested leftovers. 
 i suppose deep rising 's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre, but it does n't do much for me. 
 on the surface, and that 's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed, deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/ titanic connection, since james cameron directed both). 
 in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue- in- cheek mayhem of tremors, deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin.

 the movie 's problem is not murphy 's direction: harlem nights is a fairly good looking film. 
 no, 
 the project was probably doomed even before the cameras rolled. 
 murphy 's awful script is the culprit. 
 let 's count the mistakes 
 he makes in his first attempt at screenwriting:( 1) murphy shatters the record for the most profanity in a motion picture. 
 yes, he even outdoes his own work in raw. 
 practically every line of dialogue in harlem nights contains at least one four letter word. 
 and after 15 minutes, it gets irritating. 
( 2) murphy wastes the talents of his fine cast. 
 richard pryor, redd foxx, michael lerner, and della reese face the impossible task of carving out credible characters from a script riddled with stereotypes. 
 each of them shines occasionally, but basically what we have are good performers stuck in a bad vehicle.

 the plot might have been a pleasant change from the usual rule- the- world so often found in the james bond movies of the 70s, but here we get a confused mismash about a fabled assassin, francisco scaramanga( christopher lee, putting in a performance which is one of the rare saving graces of this movie) who someone has apparently payed one million dollars to in order to remove roger moore 's 007.

"i wish more films would take on issues of faith and morality in the modern world. 
 and i wish that film- makers would use commandments as a blueprint on how_ not_ to do it. 
 writer/ director daniel taplitz has created a bizarre conglomeration of satire and soul- searching in this tale of seth warner( aidan quinn), a man of faith who runs into a streak of bad luck which usually inspires country- western lyrics: his pregnant wife drowns, his home is destroyed by a tornado, he loses his job and his dog is crippled by a bolt of lightning. 
 convinced that god has broken his half of the covenant, seth decides to break his, and sets out to turn every"" thou shalt not"" of the ten commandments into a"" thou shalt""( and vice versa). 
 his wife 's sister rachel("" friends""' courteney cox) wants to help seth; rachel 's selfish husband harry( anthony lapaglia), who tends to break a few commandments of his own, thinks seth is a lunatic. 
 thus begins a film which picks the wrong tone for every occasion. 
 taplitz is n't interested in treating seth 's tragedies as genuinely tragic, making it impossible to sympathize with him. 
 composer joseph vitarelli provides a score full of whimsical woodwinds, turning seth 's sacrilegious mission into an amusing lark; quinn 's performance as seth is all wild- eyed fervor without any genuine pain. 
 the actual breaking of the commandments is almost treated as an afterthought, with one through five dispatched in a five- minute montage. 
 the result is a character whose actions feel less like the authentic responses of an anguished man than the machinations of a high- concept movie plot. 
 it 's not even entirely clear that commandments is about seth.

 with she 's all that and varsity blues behind us, and several more set for release later in the year, the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance. 
 however, you would n't know it from the quality of the latest entry: jawbreaker.

 they have accidentally killed one of their own, the"" teen dream"", liz purr( charlotte roldan), choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday. 
 now the three surviving girls must decide what to do. 
 it takes little time at all for the group 's leader, courtney( rose mcgowan), to decide to cover it up. 
 the ditzy marcie( julie benz) is game to go along, but the clique 's final member, julie( rebecca gayheart), has a guilty conscience. 
 to make things worse, another student, the hopelessly geeky fern mayo( judy evans greer) accidentally discovers the truth. 
 the girls' cover is surely blown... 
 not so fast. 
 thinking quickly, courtney offers fern a once- in- a- lifetime chance.

 or will this finely honed plan crack over time? 
 jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation, and failing miserably, i might add. 
 it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations, but misses three crucial elements: sharp dialogue, witty characters and the much- needed humor.

" the bachelor' is one of the best terrible movies you will ever see. wading through 
 this gooey, detestable sludge is quite the chore for even a dedicated romantic. 
 those hoping to find some genuine charm and feeling behind this chris o'donnell vehicle should wander elsewhere;` the bachelor' is a painfully clumsy mess strung together with a few brief moments of surprising poignancy. awaiting these moments by enduring the rest of the film is certainly not worth your time or money. 
 although he has not quite evolved out of the stereotypical pretty- boy cocoon, chris o'donnell has an effortless charm as an actor. 
 most will recognize him as the high- flying robin from the two latest` batman' films, but other abilities are evident behind his boyish smile. 
 can o'donnell carry the weight of a film on his shoulders? 
 perhaps, if he found the proper vehicle... 
 but` the bachelor' falls far short of the requirements. 
 the actor just ca n't register with such a pathetic screenplay as the guiding light to success. 
 a few instances of adorable humor aside, it becomes apparent that no one could save the festering mess that is` the bachelor'. 
 o'donnell plays jimmie, a hopeless romantic in his late twenties who 's progressing in a serious relationship with anne( renee zellweger). 
 jimmie takes anne out for dinner to the restaurant specifically used for proposals, and attempts to ask for her hand in marriage. 
 the problem is that his proposal sucks. 
 big time. 
 you can tell things are n't going pleasantly, because jimmie gets the infamous? deer- in- the- headlights' look when anne questions his approach.

"topless women talk about their lives falls into that category that i mentioned in the devil 's advocate: movies that have a brilliant beginning but do n't know how to end. 
 it begins by introducing us to a selection of characters who all know each other. 
 there is liz, who oversleeps and so is running late for her appointment, prue who is getting married, geoff, liz 's boyfriend, neil, her previous boyfriend, ant who has written a screenplay. 
 for the first hour, we get to know these people through everyday activities, as they talk on the phone, go out to dinner, hang clothes on the line. 
 the interactions seem so truthful and guileless that it is almost as if the film- makers hid cameras around the place and filmed these people unbeknownst to them. at times, the events border on the ridiculous, like the screening of the film, but they still seem in keeping with the characters and their lives. 
 this does n't sound like a brilliant premise for a film-"" we just follow a lot of people around who are vaguely related""- but it 's the execution of the idea that makes topless women talk about their lives so engrossing.

 comments: house on haunted hill is based upon the original 1958 film of the same title directed by william castle and starring vincent price. 
 in an obvious homage, the millionaire 's name is price and he sports a thin mustache like price used to have. 
 this is a pretty bad horror film, yet bad horror films sometimes are very entertaining, and house on haunted hill is just such a film. 
 it is, surprisingly, better than another recent haunted house remake, the haunting, a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson. 
 the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face. 
 house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b- movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it 's a crappy horror movie. 
 thus, somehow, it proves slightly more successful. 
 i ca n't think of another recent film which has had such an eclectic cast. 
 it is this cast which lifts this ho- hum thriller into a borderline entertaining exercise in camp horror 
. 
 price, the main character, is played by geoffrey rush, the academy- award winning actor of shine. 
 rush seems to be making a downward spiral in the movie industry, a spiral reminiscent of ben( ghandi, schindler 's list) kingsley 's ridiculous appearance in the camp sci- fi classic species. 
 i do n't know why, but sometimes it 's entertaining to see"" quality"" actors in bad movies. 
 more surprises?

"adam sandler vehicles are never anything special, but continue to make a load of money. 
 which really goes to show the sad state of cinema today. 
 while good comedies like rushmore, to choose a recent example, gets limited release and does n't make a lot of money, big daddy got a huge release and has made a lot of cash. 
 it 's also nothing special and does n't deserve the money it 's making 
. 
 but i digress. 
 sandler plays sonny koufax, a unemployed new yorker with a seemingly low mental age. 
 his girlfriend makes a ultimatum to him: either wise up and get responsible, or she 's leaving him. 
 by a strange set of events, koufax ends up with julian( played by twins cole and dylan sprouse) a five year old kid. 
 after a failed attempt to impress his girlfriend with the child, koufax decides he wants to keep the child.

 koufax along with his new girlfriend layla( lauren adams) fight to keep the child. 
 big daddy 
 really is n't that good. 
 many of the jokes revolve around toilet humour, and supposedly we are meant to find julian and sonny peeing against a wall to be funny

 there 's the occasional good one liner, but these are usually strangely delivered wrong and lose most of the humour. 
 the film, after all these silly gags, then suddenly turns sentimental, and this is where big daddy really goes from bad to hideous.

"any movie that kills emilio estevez off in the first fifteen minutes has something going for it. 
 unfortunately, this and the familiar theme music are the only worthwhile things about mission impossible, directed by brian depalma. 
 the first problem is that this film has absolutely no connection with the tv show whatsoever, aside from the music. 
 the tv show was about an impossible mission force whose deft teamwork, orchestrated by jim phelps, allowed them to counfound evil dictators of mythic banana republics from inflicting their sordid schemes upon the world. 
 teamwork was the key. 
 this film is set up as a cross between james bond and depalma 's"" blow out,"" where the john travolta character was the victim of real and imagined conspiracies from all directions. 
 it was travolta 's vulnerability that made that film so exciting and claustrophobic. 
 in this film, tom cruise is basically omniscient 
( believe that?) and so 
 there 's no fun going on here whatsoever. 
 the story is about as contrived as contrived gets, and is full of holes. 
 there are basically two memorable sequences: one involves breaking into a kubrickesque computer room -- a task that could have been made much easier had the characters a whit of common sense( suffice it to say that the alarm system is disengaged when the computer operator is in the room); the second involves a high- speed train, a helicopter, and the chunnel and does not have to be seen to be disbelieved. 
 the actors are all miscast, especially emannuelle beart as jim phelps wife, who can not act, and ving rhames as a computer hacker(!), who looks lost and embarrased to be in this movie.

"movies based on video games, such as street fighter or mario bros., have never generated much interest at the box office. 
 but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995, it did surprisingly well. 
 with a simple story, a pulsating soundtrack, and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes, the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy. 
 it got my vote for' the movie where i expected the least and got the most'. 
 and, if you have n't had the opportunity, i would definitely recommend that you see it on video. 
 in the world of mortal kombat, based on the popular arcade game, dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth 's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity. 
 the mortal kombat refers to a competition, fought by human mortals against outworld 's minions, which if won, will guarantee earth 's safety for another generation. 
 mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition. 
 despite their victory, however, a gateway has somehow opened, and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth. 
 outworld 's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters, including shao kahn, mintoro( a centaur), sheeva( a four- armed ogre), and sindel. 
 earth 's mortal warriors, under the leadership of the benevolent god, lord rayden, includes liu kang, princess kitana, sonya blade and jax, who must fight against outworld 's forces. 
 it 's an easy enough premise, but unfortunately( very unfortunately), the writers try to do too much with the movie 
. 
 it is only a video game, after all, but the on- screen version tries to go beyond it 's comic book boundaries by adding depth, a conceptualization of self- worth, and worst of all, a love story.

 jim west is a quick- draw lawman who teams up with brainiac federal agent gordon, under orders from president grant( kline again, whose impression, for all we know, is dead- on), to apprehend legless loveless, the mad inventor who is plotting to divvy up the united states and sell it back to britain and spain. 
 how will loveless accomplish this?

 but somehow, they ran into a problem along the way. 
 they were so busy trying to fill specific roles that they forgot one in general that would 've made all the difference- a story writer.

"the summer of 00' was n't a very good one for devout cinephiles.

"what do you get when you rip- off good movies like woody allen 's bananas and martin scorsese 's after hours? 
 you 'd think you 'd get the best of both films. 
 instead you get woo. 
 falling in somewhere between def jam 's how to be a player( which was awful) and booty call( which was ok), woo is yet another in the embarassing genre of showing african- americans to be nothing more than sexual buffoons. 
 the whole film plays out as a black version of after hours, as wild woman woo( jada pinkett smith) goes out on a blind date with straight- laced tim( tommy davidson). 
 mayhem follows them. 
 for some unknown reason( read: 
 contrived screenplay) davidson puts up with all of woo 's antics for the entire night, which include her destroying his bathroom mirror, stealing things from his house, violently questioning him( accusing and belittling him actually) about previous girlfriends, causing a riot in an elegant restaurant, and other various infuriating things that any normal person would n't tolerate. 
 but for the sake of this bad movie? 
 sure, why not? 
 there are a few chuckles in the film, the best being the scene swiped directly from bananas. 
 in this case, davidson is running from thugs, gets into a subway car as the doors are closing, starts to taunt the thugs, then the doors open back up again. 
 a good joke, but a stolen one. 
 another chuckle is provided by billy dee williams' cameo as himself. 
 movies like woo are seemingly released every three months or so, and not one of them has ever been a hit.

"wild things is a way to steam up an otherwise dreary early spring day? 
 provided, of course, that you 're the victim of a frontal lobotomy. 
 there is, in fact, no doubt about who this motion picture is aimed at: movie- goers in their late teens and early twenties -- the most lucrative target group. 
 this is film noir for the mtv generation: fast- paced, slick, flashy, gleefully mindless, and hollow to the core. 
 wild things is easily one of the five dumbest movies to arrive in theaters during the first eleven weeks of 1998. 
 i 've seen more convincing drama( with nearly as much bare flesh) on that pinnacle of narrative quality, baywatch. 
 wild things wants to dupe viewers into thinking it 's a thriller with a real story. 
 what it is, however, is a series of increasingly- improbable and shockingly predictable plot twists. 
 everything in between those serpentine moments is filler -- a flash of a breast, a spatter of blood, and some of the most idiotic dialogue this side of a steven seagal movie. 
 the film tries so hard to surprise its audience that the twists end up being easy to guess -- just take a stab at the most unlikely thing to happen, and that will probably be it. using this approach, i was right three times and wrong only once. 
 that 's not a good average for a production that wants to keep viewers in the dark about what 's around the next corner. 
 the ad campaign uses two things to sell this movie: the hot, young cast and the old standby, sex. 
 both have an abundance of screen time, although i 'll admit that the film 's erotic content is somewhat less impressive than i expected. 
 nothing about wild things is exceptionally risqu?.

 the story begins as jesse( charasmatic colin farrell) and his brother frank( gabriel macht), cole and scott younger( scott caan, will mccormack) and trusty comanche tom( nathaniel arcand), after four years of fighting for the rebs in the civil war, return to liberty, missouri- only to discover union troops are occupying their hometown. 
 and an avaricious east coast railroad baron, thaddeus rains( harris yulin), is forcing farmers to sell their land at less than true value, aided by allan pinkerton( timothy dalton) and his infamous detectives who, back then, were just thugs who provided security. 
 but when ma james( kathy bates) becomes one of their victims, jesse and the rest of the guys( gregory smith, ty o'neal, joe stevens) form the james- younger gang to wreak revenge by attacking the railroad 's supply lines, sabotaging track and robbing the banks where the payroll is kept.

"robin williams has the rarest of gifts: the ability to rise above the most inept material and suffuse it with his irreverent style.

 so when i, the one person who has refused to abandon him despite patch adams, tell you that not even williams can save his latest project, you know 
 it 's in trouble. 
 jakob the liar is a confused, muddled little movie; a generically"" uplifting"" film with a fundamental contradiction: 
 the message it delivers is depressing as opposed to inspiring and the movie does n't realize it. 
 williams plays jakob haim, a jew imprisoned in a polish ghetto during world war ii. 
 one night he wanders outside after curfew and is promptly sent to the office of a high- ranking german officer for his punishment. 
 jakob gets off easy and he gets to hear approximately 30 seconds of a radio broadcast. 
 the announcement( in english, but punctuated by a triumphant"" heil hitler!"") is that russian troops are only miles away from jakob 's ghetto. 
 liberation! 
 he thinks. 
 the next day, jakob tells the news to his closest friend, a volatile prize fighter named misha( liev schreiber), who despite being sworn to secrecy passes the message along. 
 soon, it is a common assumption in the ghetto that jakob has a radio hidden in his home -- a crime punishable by death. 
 this is absurdly false, but the more jakob tells the people of the ghetto this, the more convinced they become that he is abreast of the latest developments in the war that is to decide their fate. 
 the danger, of course, is that the germans allegedly have informants throughout the ghetto, and rumors about the radio can get out and put jakob in great danger.

"it should have been a classic. 
 a great cast of respected supporting actors. 
 an interesting premise of loser comic book characters. 
 however,"" mystery men"" proved to be one of the great disappointments of 1999. 
 the jokes were bland and hackneyed from talents who have previously made audiences laugh with their unique rituals. 
 the number of cliches and shallow characters made the film difficult to sit through seriously hurting its attempt of having a fast paced premise. 
 the script tried to deliver a series of small jokes throughout the film but without a big laugh- out- loud joke and mediocre small jokes, it failed miserably at being entertaining at all. 
 the jokes were not funny for a number of reasons. 
 they had been used a number of times before in previous films, the best ones, which were mediocre to begin with, were ruined in the trailer, and the expectation of laughing at clever, unique gags from clever unique comedians when there were none to laugh at greatly damaged the film. 
"" mystery men"" might have worked if it was an ensemble cast of newcomers trying to break into the business.

"breakdown is an moderately entertaining, if underwhelming, thriller. 
 kurt russell and kathleen quinlan play couple jeff and amy taylor, taking the scenic route to california through redneck country.

"synopsis: a man whose lover, paris, was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system. 
 the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend, laura, and becomes addicted to virtual reality, which, due to a design flaw in his unit, recreates the dead paris. 
 comments: virtual seduction, executive produced by roger corman and lance h. robbins, serves as a cheaply- made precursor to strange days, a far superior film. 
 both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are( ab) using technology to be with former lovers( in strange days, the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality). 
 interestingly, both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium, though strange days uses the setting far more effectively. 
 this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction. 
 it 's not bad for what it is: low- budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality. 
 unfortunately, it 's been done before and since in much better films, a fact which ultimately leaves the sci- fi fan bored by this movie. 
 virtual seduction has many faults 
( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins). 
 the film 's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first, but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy- handed and wooden as the movie progresses. 
 many important scenes seem too dark; the lighting could have been improved significantly. 
 the cast, a collection of veteran b- movie actors and sitcom regulars, do only a mediocre job in their roles.

 unenergetically

 nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing, or at least curious to see the next turn, throughout the entire movie.

 we start off in a high- class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making. 
 guidance counselor sam lombardo( matt dillon) seems to catch the eye of every student, particularly kelly van ryan( richards), daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts.

"i was recently told that in china their had been strong protests against the release of red corner, and this is apparently because of the way it shows the injustice of many chinese laws. 
 but if you ask me, the real truth of the matter is that the chinese critics association were determined not to punish the population into viewing richard gere running across rooftops in search for a fellow american. 
 or more the point, anyone that allows him to bask in his own less- than- subtle presence. 
 this is not an insult to gere, as i consider him to be a rather talented actor, but more the choice of character and responsibility of his role. 
 if a film is solely about one person, the main actor must give a faultless performance in order for it to really work. 
 although gere 's performance is in no way poorly acted, it is far from perfect, and i look forward to seeing him star with other talented actors that can reduce the need for him to carry a film by himself. 
 this is where he truly belongs, and if you are reluctant to believe me than look no further that primal fear( with the sensational edward norton), the jackal( with bruce willis) and pretty woman( with the delightful julia roberts). 
 in red corner gere plays classy lawyer jack moore, who is guilty of the same personality traits as his character martin vail in primal fear, bold and up front, who thinks he is three steps ahead of everybody else but is actually two steps behind. 
 it is with invulnerability of both mental and physical kind that the character of moore is portrayed, which left me barracking for the chinese to haul his sorry ass into jail.

"part buddy comedy, part fish- out- of- water story, part nature tale, meet the deedles is not nearly as interesting as any of those archetypes. 
 in fact, it is an invitation you ought to disregard. phil and stew deedle( paul walker and steve van wormer) are the twin sons of the famous millionaire, elton deedle( eric braeden), founder of deedle enterprises. 
 elton wants his sons to be the perfect heirs to his fortune... 
 instead the two are careless hawaiian surf bums. 
 to set them straight, he enrolls them into a strict wyoming boot camp, to which the pair inevitably go. 
 after several misadventures in wyoming, where the duo is stunned to discover there 's no surf, the brothers deedle stumble upon a routine mistaken identity plot. 
 they arrive at yellowstone national park, where they are believed to be two new park ranger recruits. rather than slinking back home and disappointing their dad, the deedles play along.

"in the interest of being generous, i want to start this review with the scene that i liked in meet joe black. 
 sir anthony hopkins, playing a super- rich media mogul, has gathered his family around him for dinner. 
 his oldest daughter( played by marcia gay harden from millers crossing), who has been obsessively planning his sinfully extravagant birthday party, presents him with three superbly decorated little cakes, which are supposed to be scale models for his big birthday cake. 
 the daughter asks hopkins to pick the one he likes. 
 hopkins, frustrated by the weight of planning for the whole elaborate affair, does what any man in his position would do: he punts. 
 whichever one you like, dear, he says. 
 and the daughter does exactly what any woman in her position would do: she cries. 
 i liked that scene for two reasons. 
 first, the cakes looked really cool. 
 second, it was, perhaps, the only scene in the movie where people acted as you would expect people to act. 
 meet joe black is chock- full of odd performances, people doing things for no discernible reason at all, and doing them in slow motion over the course of three hours to boot 
. 
 it 's easy to watch meet 
 joe black for the abundant eye candy of the palatial homes and the beauteous claire forlani, 
 but it 's even easier to sleep right through it

 the difficult part of the movie is understanding the characters and their motivations and why someone thought three hours was an appropriate length for this overwrought mess.

 case in point: everyone should know by now that brad pitt plays the angel of death in this movie.

 the preceding has been the plot of approximately twelve thousand and six action films; this one just happens to be called metro. 
 i have learned to expect little from films like metro, and consequently i am bored by them more often than i am genuinely disappointed. with eddie murphy on board, however, you hope for something extra, some kind of spark. 
 when a film makes watching eddie murphy a tedious experience, you know it is doing something terribly wrong. 
 murphy stars as scott roper, a hostage negotiator for the san francisco police department who is exceedingly good at his job. 
 with his personal life, he is considerably less successful, facing an unhappy ex- girlfriend named veronica( carmen ejogo), a gambling problem and a mountain of debt. 
 then his professional life gets a jolt as well when a friend and colleague( art evans) is murdered while investigating suspected jewel thief michael korda( michael wincott). 
 finding korda becomes very personal to scott, and he joins with new partner kevin mccall( michael rappaport) to foil korda during an attempted heist. 
 but all is not well even with korda in jail, as scott, veronica and kevin all continue to face life- threatening danger. 
 metro( the title, in case you are wondering, means absolutely nothing) is so badly put together that even the most casual viewer may notice the miserable pacing and stray plot threads. 
 in the first place, korda 's rage over being discovered before he can make his big score is rendered completely pointless when he proceeds to hit the target anyway( and, incidentally,",negative,"The reviewer criticizes the movie for being unoriginal and boring, even with the presence of a star like Eddie Murphy.

"can a horror movie truly be called a horror movie if it has no scares, suspense, or even eerie elements? 
 i think not, but that 's what children of the corn 666: issac 's return wants us to believe. 
 the sixth installment in the horrible, worn out series is by far the worst to date 
. 
 unlike the other five chapters, children of the corn 666 is a confusing, brainless thriller that takes the psychological horror route rather than slasher horror, but either way, none of these movies are the least bit scary. 
 the film follows hannah( natalie ramsey) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin, nebraska, on the eve of her 21st birthday. 
 what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn, who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder. 
 that 's about all that 's understandable in the film, as after we learn this much, issac( john franklin) who led the children of the corn in a previous chapter, now an older, strange man, is looking for hannah to fulfill his prophecy. 
 and this is supposed to make sense. 
 really. 
 from the start the film is unclear of where its going, not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table, constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality, and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film. 
 the film runs at a short 78 minutes, but it seems to be more in the vicinity of two hours, as the bleak, slow pacing makes children of the corn 666: issac 's return excruciatingly boring

"i still ca n't figure out why people went in droves to see this movie. 
 now before you go assuming i 'm some sort of high brow snob, who ca n't appreciate a little dumb humor, let me say that i love cheap humor. 
 i thought there 's something about mary was one of the funniest films that i have ever seen and it was certainly one of the best films of 1998.

 the problem with the waterboy is the same as most other adam sandler movies.

 nothing could be further from the truth, as matter of fact, sandler 's idiot voice started to get on my nerves at points in this film. 
 it 's really a shame too, because this film had the potential to be very funny. 
 i personally believe that sandler is probably a very talented comedian, it 's just that so far he has n't been able to find the right film to showcase his talents. 
 if his only talent is making goofy voices and playing morons, my guess is that his career in the movies will go down the same road as the vast majority of the former stars of saturday night live.

 they finally get to see him live 
 and he is screwed out of his title by the evil, ruthless promoter titus sinclair( a wasted palitaliano, in a role originally meant for real- life wcw president eric bischoff, whose name was written all over the role!). 
 gordie and sean track down king in atlanta and discover that he is not really the english king the wcw writers created for him, but a drunken, ignorant southerner who is as irritated by these two lunkheads as bob newhart was by larry, darryl, and darryl.

 wcw president eric bischoff, knowing his promotion was desperate with bad writing and ratings skyrocketing down thanks to the far superior world wrestling federation, came up with the idea for this movie hoping it would save wcw.

 his maxim might be easily applied to writing a comedy script, for quantity over quality is one of the worst mistakes an amateur scribe can make.

 but unfailingly, judge manages to make some rather inexcusable mistakes in office space by spreading an iffy plot over too much ground. 
 the iffiness in judge 's plot -- a group of coworkers plan the downfall of their despicable boss -- is not in its appeal. 
 in fact, based on the popularity of scott adams' cartoon"" dilbert,"" which will soon have its own television series, a satirical view of the american workplace is a hot item in hollywood. 
 unfortunately the concept lends itself to skit- length sequences which would be more at home on the set of"" saturday night live"" rather than a full- length feature.

 the movie is a shoddy cheesefest full of digital eye candy, stapled carelessly onto a flimsy screenplay which somehow manages to leapfrog the great promise of a space opera, instead shooting for the angle of a feel- good science fiction drama more akin to` 2001: a space odyssey'. 
 i got the feeling that most of my fellow movie- going patrons were expecting another` armageddon'. 
 but no,` mission to mars' certainly is n't one large action sequence about colossal disaster. 
 this is a supposedly thoughtful, family- friendly space flick in which the apocalyptic excitement takes a back seat to visual elegance and uplifting drivel. 
 you have been warned. 
 of course, crafting a tightly claustrophobic space drama is not impossible( see` apollo 13' for an excellent example), but few directors possess the skill and craftsmanship to pull it off without seriously scarring their reputation. 
 brian de palma has enough directorial expertise and visual wizardry up his sleeve to pull it off. 
 when he gets his hands on an intelligent, systematically practical script like` the untouchables' or` mission: impossible', the director has the ability to create a sound technical achievement( although his overly indulgent style becomes bothersome more than occasionally). 
 of course, there 's also the inexcusable string of crap that has carried his name( including` snake eyes' and the notorious bomb` the bonfire of the vanities')....

 the alien fun and games begin this time when a three- person astronaut crew returning from mars inadvertently carries within their soil samples deadly alien dna that eventually infects the mission captain, patrick ross( justin lazard, late of cbs 's short- lived soap of a few years back, central park west/ cpw). 
 this alien dna is not identical to that which created the original film 's sil, but it 's close enough, and upon arrival on earth patrick is mating like crazy, engaging in bloody sex with just about every woman he can find. 
 meanwhile, scientist dr. 
 laura baker( the returning marg helgenberger) has created a clone of sil named eve( natasha henstridge again) for research purposes. 
 it does n't take long for eve to sense another alien presence, which send her libido into hyperdrive. 
 it 's up to laura and her former partner, bounty hunter press lennox( michael madsen, another returnee); and patrick 's uninfected shipmate dennis gamble( mykelti williamson) to find patrick before the in- heat eve does.

"the marvelous british actor derek jacobi stars in writer and director john maybury 's love is the devil about the popular modern artist francis bacon.

 that 's the bottom line on disney 's incredibly hyped live action version of its 1961 animated feature.

 when production of this remake was announced, the big question seemed to be"" why? 
 the original cartoon still works, so what 's the point?

 the answer, it appears, is to give disney an excuse for yet another massive merchandising campaign. 
 the story, for those of you who missed childhood, is simple. 
 two dalmatians, pongo and perdy, fall in love at first sight. 
 they drag their"" human pets"" together, and in a short time both couples marry. 
 the heavenly match- ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy 's new- born pups are stolen; their dog- napping engineered by the evil cruella devil, who wants them for their pelts. 
 everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies.

"it 's time to take cover. 
 after a hiatus of about fifteen years, the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest. 
 in early 1997, there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone, one on television and two in the theaters, with dante 's peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar. 
 of the two, i had heard that dante 's peak was the better film, so i decided to check it out when it was released on video. 
 the film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town. 
 the town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption. 
 flaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky, crushing homes and people. 
 we see people panicking, people crying, and even horses rearing. 
 it is a disaster of biblical proportions, signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road. 
 symbolism does n't get much more blatant than that. 
 we learn that harry dalton( pierce brosnan), a volcanologist with the u. s. 
 geological survey, was there with his wife when the eruption occurred. 
 harry survived, but his wife did not. 
 a few years later, harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante 's peak, washington( which, we are told, has been voted second most desirable place to live( under 20, 000) by the readers of money magazine). 
 there harry meets rachel wando, a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante 's peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop. 
 although the mayor does n't seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up, a few members of the city council are. 
 they are afraid that harry 's presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante 's peak.",negative,"The review criticizes the movie for its lack of originality and depth, and for its focus on disaster scenes rather than character development or plot.

 it 's ostensibly about some important social issue that we 're all tangling with. 
 it is not, however, a good movie, and all of the reasons i 've listed above have something to do with why. 
 right from the beginning, the movie is dead- set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible.

 after their arrest, their father( jackson) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial.

 although the movie never explains it, a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley.

 jonathon brandis is a nice surprise as matthew, who agrees to dress up as a girl named martha to help out chester( probably because the girl he has a crush on plays on the team- what original story ideas!).

"robin williams, this time without a beard, returns to drama in this sloppy, sickly sweet fantasy with few redeeming features apart from the incredible effects. 
 he plays chris nielsen, who meets annie( annabella sciora) and promptly marries her. 
 they have two great kids, who sadly die in a car crash. 
 just when it could n't get any worse, chris gets killed in a car crash, and goes to heaven where he meets his guide albert( gooding jnr.)

 the' penalty' for suicide is to go to hell, and chris goes on a mission to try and rescue her using the help of the traveller( max von sydow.) 
 based on a novel by twilight zone writer richard matheson, what dreams may come is clunky, manufactured material doused with a extra load of sugar. 
 this is the worse spielberg film spielberg never made. 
 everything is wrong about this movie: the performances are forced, and the audiences fail to relate to any of the characters.

 well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is, williams ca n't take all the blame, but he sure ca n't justify himself with his own simple tag line either. 
 fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy, turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide- eyed at a poster of the earth. 
 as a 30-year- old, fred has n't grown up much, but at least he 's somewhat closer to his goal, now designing astronaut software for nasa.

 fred. 
 yes, although he 's an obviously klutzy moron, nasa does n't think twice about throwing him into a rigorous training program so he can assist one of the most important events the space program, and time itself, has ever known. 
 for the first part of the film, we watch as fred takes on the training program much like an amusement park. 
 he laughs, he screams, but he never once breaks a sweat or views the preparation as anything more than child 's play.

"based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad, victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers, heyst( william dafoe) and alma( irene jacob), who seek refuge on heyst 's isolated island. 
 however, their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones( sam neil), martin ricardo( rufus sewell) and their servant, pedro( graziano marcelli), who have come to steal heyst 's rumoured plunder. 
 while the novel is largely complex in characterization, the film sadly transposes conrad 's characters into lacklustre leads, the most disappointing being heyst himself. 
 conrad 's heyst adheres religiously to his late father 's ways of detachment and isolation. 
 his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice. 
 the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude, however, is lost in mark peploe 's( director and writer) diluted version of heyst. without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst 's character, all that is left of conrad 's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement. 
 on the one hand, actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task( though not impossible), but on the other hand, dafoe 's flat acting can not be excused as an attempt at stoicism. 
 in the end, we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another. 
 the final transformation, while perceptible, lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad 's novel. 
 its absence in the film is unforgivable. 
 the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers. 
 alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship, namely heyst 's underlying philosophy of detachment, which heyst himself grapples with. 
 the struggle against heyst 's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma 's love for him. 
",negative,The reviewer criticizes the movie for its lackluster character development and flat acting. The reviewer also mentions that the film fails to capture the complexity of the novel it is based on and lacks a cathartic revelation.,0.13017411125794268

 this particular weapon( nicknamed` elvis') must be kept below a temperature of 50 degrees, or else the shockwave will goo- iffy everything in a mile radius.

"retrospective: city of the living dead( 1980) 
 a film review by mike watson copyright 1997 
 mike watson 
 i once heard someone describe the films of italian schlock horror director lucio fulci as"" dim- witted"". 
 and by golly, just about all other words fail me when confronted with a dog like city of the living dead. 
 although the late fulci managed some rather good thrillers in his career, this is not one of them. 
 two points in the movie 's favour- 
 the impressive camerawork of sergio salvati and occasionally evocative score by fabio frizzi- keep things from falling totally into the abyss, but by and large city of the living dead is a failure. 
 and like most cinematic failures, it comes down to bad writing, dumb performances and lousy direction. 
 the story starts in new york when, during a seance, a medium( katherine mccoll) sees a vision of a priest hanging himself in the town of dunwich, massachusetts. 
 for reasons we wo n't go into here, this opens the gates of hell which must be closed by all saints day or the dead will rise and walk the earth. 
 the medium apparently dies of fright during the seance, but awakens in her coffin in the graveyard the next day and is rescued by a crusty old journalist( christopher george). 
 that scene in itself is a howler 
: why would you bust open a coffin with a large pick axe when you know someone is alive inside? 
 and do n't cadavers have various things stuffed in them and drained out of them before they 're buried? 
 anyway, off the two of them go to dunwich to save the world, where various grisly goings- on are already happening as all saints day approaches. 
 fulci 's 
 graphic gore is in evidence once again, but here it only serves to further highlight the film 's flimsy script and plodding direction. 
 the dialogue, in all manner of speaking, is unspeakable.

 it 's time to embrace for impact, because this is a very bumpy ride. 
 the story begins with the cast of galaxy quest including: jason nesmith( tim allen), alexander dane( alan rickman), gwen demarco( sigourney weaver) signing autographs at a convention. 
 they meet fans who dress up in costumes, fans who worship the ground they walk on, and a group of aliens called thermians who believe that they are the ultimate saviors against the dreaded alien colony lead by sarris( robin sachs).

"the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous 
 as this summer 's other comic book adaptation, batman and robin.

"the people who populate the movie 54 are shallow, self- absorbed and self- indulgent. 
 in other words, they perfectly mirror the era as well as the movie this feature depicts. 
 54 is the story of that well- publicized new york disco, studio 54, the in- place in the' 70s where anybody who was anybody went to be ogled, photographed and pampered. 
 the difficulty with 54, which was written and directed by mark christopher, is that his script takes no point of view. 
 christopher 
 neither condemns nor glorifies the legendary excesses that were studio 54 's hallmark. 
 he keeps an uninvolved distance, thus keeping us from forming any emotional attachment with any of the protagonists. 
 the movie 's one main asset is the surprising performance by mike myers as steve rubell, the famous owner of the nightspot. 
 he is part rebel, part dreamer, part shrewd entrepreneur. 
 he 's smart enough and childlike enough to pander to the dreams and desires of his clientele, yet stupid enough to brag on tv about hiding profits from the irs. 
 myers, in his first straight character part, is in turn appealing and appalling. 
 at one moment he can try to pressure a male employee into a sexual situation, then at the next moment apologize for his bad behavior and offer the young man a handful of cash. 
 the story is told by shane o'shea( ryan phillippe), a new jersey lad who dreams of crossing the river to the big apple. 
 shades of john travolta 's brooklyn- bound tony in saturday night fever. 
 eventually, shane does come to new york, attracts rubell 's eye and is admitted to the promised land.

 the film concerns an english/ drama teacher at a suburban high school, named howard brackett. 
 he loves poetry and great literary works, but his class is more interested in his famous former student, played by matt dillon. 
( i 'd put in his name, but my wife wo n't let me take notes during a movie and i 've forgotten it.) 
 they continually interrupt his long poetic expositions with fawning questions about him. 
 brackett has been engaged to another teacher( played by joan cusack) for three years, and has finally gotten up the gumption to marry her. 
 the wedding, however, becomes the big question mark of the film as this famous student of his says during the live oscar broadcast that brackett is a homosexual. 
 kline spends most of the first two- thirds of the film frantically trying to convince everyone that he is n't. 
 the whole town begins to examine every detail of his life and begins to identifying all those things that confirm his sexual preference. 
 his closest friends do n't help matters, bringing nothing but barbara streisand laserdiscs to his stag party.

 paltrow and johnathon schaech play helen and jackson, a photogenic new york couple on their way to spend christmas vacation at his wealthy, well- to- do family 's horse farm/ estate kilronan. 
 jackson 's mother martha( lange) runs kilronan all by herself, and her genteel southern hospitality makes helen feel welcome immediately -- even if her first meeting with martha takes place while helen is in the altogether, caught red- handed after a bedroom romp with her husband- to- be.

"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year. 
 earlier this may, leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top- rated miniseries that debuted on cbs. 
 and now, director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies. 
 starring milla jovovich, who is predominantly unconvincing 
 as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch,` the messenger: the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re- enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend. 
 besson( who 's previous work includes the hyperactive sci- fi` the fifth element') perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex- wife jovovich, because in` the messenger', the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience. 
 at first, when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role, i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber. 
 after seeing the rousing trailer, my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed- milla jovovich looked superb. 
 with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance,` the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making. 
 a timeless epic 
 it is not. 
 besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style, and the story behind` the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands. 
 on the shoulders of besson 's choppy and unexciting direction, the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery. 
 there is no human exploration into the character of joan( or jeanne). 
 jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective.

 a definition of dishonor can be anything from making a stupid decision to leaving one family for another. 
 it would be interesting to know more about where these and other customs come from. 
 unfortunately the film does n't give too much of an explanation, assuming its audience is aware of kitano 's earlier work. 
 there are several shots that focus specifically on detailed tattoos that spread across the entire back of the yakuza members, leading one to assume they would be symbolic of something, but you never know what. 
 then there 's a scene in which a man kills himself in front of a rival in exchange for that rival joining the family. 
 granted, this is one of the best scenes in the movie, but it does n't make a lot of sense.

 review by: 
 geoff berkshire 
 i 'm not an overly cynical guy. 
 there have been many glossy hollywood romances that have carried me away with their romanticism over the years. 
 however, i have my limits and i also have standards. 
 this brings us to the subject at hand: message in a bottle, the big ticket romance that warner brothers' unleashed upon the movie going public just in time for valentine 's day. 
 the story, what little of it that there is, involves boring chicago tribune reporter theresa osborne( robin wright- penn) dealing with her recent divorce and trying to raise her young son jason( jesse james). 
 during a brief stay somewhere in new england she finds the titular message in a bottle while on a morning run by the ocean. 
 the letter, written to a mystery woman named catherine, instantly captivates her. 
 upon her return, theresa shares it with her best friend lina( illeana douglas), her boss charlie( robbie coltrane), and the entire city of chicago( the newspaper publishes an article about it). 
 it turns out that the message was written by grieving widower garret blake( kevin costner) and so theresa travels to north carolina and tracks him down. 
 he turns out to have a colorful father( paul newman) but is otherwise perfectly dull and overly obsessed with sailing. 
 this is somehow attractive to theresa and the two begin their awkward courtship. 
 of course she does n't tell him that she found his letter, she wants to but the rules of this type of film require him to find out later( preferably right after they first make love). 
 this way garret can get very angry and the relationship can be threatened.

"disconnect the phone line. 
 do n't accept the charges. 
 do anything you can to avoid the wretched, melodramatic sisterhood dramedy` hanging up'. 
 i figured i needed to get in touch with my feminine side, and` hanging up' seemed like an ideal opportunity to do so. 
 the film features an incredible palate of female talent, and the capability behind the camera brought to mind such sparkling gems as` sleepless in seattle' and` unsung heroes'. 
 meg ryan, diane keaton and lisa kudrow play a trio of sisters who, once separated by career judgments over family ties, must reunite when their father( walter matthau) is admitted into the hospital with alzheimer 's disease. 
 while this may read like an optimum opportunity to rekindle their relationship and reflect with poignancy on the past, the script by sisters delia and nora ephron 
 is exasperating, shapeless dreck teeming with emotional fakery. 
` hanging up' has the overall effect of a tele- marketer pestering you for two hours, while you do n't have the option of doing as the title suggests. 
 for the first half- hour, the ephron sisters use telephone conversations for a basis of character development. 
 this is an annoying and ineffective device. 
 cell- phones ring every five minutes, and everyone hurriedly rushes along, leaving marginal time for the frustrated viewer to relate to the sisters' issues and problems. 
 if` hanging up' was an apple pie, then i felt as if we were getting the mere crust of the story. 
 granted, there are a few genuine and sincere moments in the film. 
 but they only help to establish that the remainder of the strained emotions are nothing but inferior dramatic muck. 
 the most outrageous strategy in` hanging up' is that, after a series of largely unrealized attempts at character development, we are expected to exhibit compassion and courtesy toward the sisters as they join for a melodramatic finale. 
 we are able to identify with eve( ryan), the most open and caring daughter, because she is",negative,"The reviewer criticizes the movie ""Hanging Up"" for its ineffective storytelling and lack of character development.

"in china in 1982 i turned the tables on our national guide and asked him if he had any questions about america.

 even in china people seem to have problems relating to in- laws. 
 perhaps some of life 's most difficult relationships arise when families are suddenly artificially joined by marriage. 
 a man trying to relate to his new prospective in- laws and vice- versa could be the basis of a very strong comedy. 
 meet the parents does not demonstrate that fact, however. 
 greg focker( played by ben stiller) has been dating and in love with pam byrnes( teri polo) for ten months and is now ready to propose to her. 
 he will do it during a weekend visit to meet debbie 's family and to attend her sister 's wedding.

 under no circumstances will they ever let themselves be seen eating in public. 
 in writer and director darren stein 's jawbreaker, it is n't as funny as it sounds. 
 in fact, it is n't funny at all. 
 stein has taken the black comedy of a teen movie like heathers and stripped it of any intelligence, wit or charm. 
 his actresses toss off their lines so fast that they do n't have time to add any emotion. 
 and all of his female characters have considerably more lipstick than brains. 
 the setup for the movie has one of the fab 4, liz, who is referred to as"" the princess di of reagan high,"" be killed when a prank by the other 3 goes wrong. 
 the princess di reference is in bad taste, as is much of the movie. 
 granted, bad taste can sometimes be funny, but the mere presence of bad taste does n't guarantee it. 
 liz 's girlfriends stick a jawbreaker that is literally larger than a golf ball in her mouth, tape her mouth shut, and stick her bound body in the trunk of a car. 
 when they open the trunk later, liz is dead.

"i have little against remakes and updates of older films and tv series. 
 if there 's a will, there 's a way; and i believe that anything, no matter how great or revered can be effectively improved upon. 
 this is the reason that i responded so well to gus van sant 's universally panned update of psycho; i thought it to be not only an intriguing cinematic experience, but also very on- par with an original. 
 but i do have a big problem with remakes that are blatantly bad. 
 you see, the point of a remake is, or at least it should be, to iron out the original 's flaws and bring the work that much closer to greatness or even perfection.

 this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg 's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst. 
 mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat- out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison. 
 writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill. 
 the plot, for what its worth, concerns two brothers( nathan lane and an appalling lee evens) who inherit a poorly run string factory and a seemingly worthless house from their eccentric father. deciding to check out the long- abandoned house, they soon learn that it 's worth a fortune and set about selling it in auction to the highest bidder. 
 but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse, happy with his run- down little abode and wanting it to stay that way. 
 the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe. 
 whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue, terrible overacting, and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury, signifying nothing.

 eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind. 
 twister, as inane as the script might have been, at least required some creative technicians; mission: impossible, overwrought plot and all, at least involved genuine effort. 
 eddie just sits there, hawking up a formula story without any laughs, and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required. 
 whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin, a new york limo driver and die- hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team. 
 coach john bailey( dennis farina) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas, and the losses are beginning to mount. 
 the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess( frank langella) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team. 
 the winner( surprise, surprise) is eddie, who becomes a fan favorite, and eventually the actual coach. 
 the knicks continue to lose, but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops. 
 incidentally, the knicks eventually start winning.

"as any reasonable human being would, i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things. 
 i am befuddled by fight club. 
 now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later. 
 perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time. 
 perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in

 they begin fight club, an organization based on brutal and bloody fistfights that signify nothing other than to provide those that join a sense of belonging.

"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor, his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality. 
 like everyone else, dreyfuss has bills to pay, so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies. 
 consequently, while his career highlights include jaws, close encounters of the third kind, stakeout, and tin men, his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador, let it ride, and now krippendorf 's tribe. 
 let me start out by saying that krippendorf 's tribe is occasionally funny( although never riotously so), but that 's about its only asset. 
 the best word to describe this film is"" asinine. 
"" the target audience would appear to be recent nursery school graduates if not for the numerous sexual innuendoes, which are aimed at someone going through puberty. 
 krippendorf 's tribe tries to be a zany, off- the- wall comedy, but the film makers have forgotten three important rules. 
 the first is that some minimal level of plot credibility has to exist. 
 the second is that viewers should be able to identify with, or at least care about, a character or two. finally, and most importantly, more than 5% of the jokes have to work. 
 once upon a time, james krippendorf( dreyfuss) was a respected professor of anthropology at little bounderby college. 
 he and his wife obtained a grant to seek out a"" lost tribe"" somewhere in the wilds of new guinea, a goal which they never accomplished. 
 shortly after their return from the failed trip, krippendorf 's wife died and he was left with the herculean task of raising three children -- shelly( natasha lyonne), mickey( gregory smith), and edmund( carl michael linder) -- on his own.

"movies about teenagers and teenage culture rarely prove to be either interesting, entertaining or convincing, because of one fundamental reason: movies are made by adults and not teenagers. 
 occasionally, however, films like say anything, dazed and confused and the breakfast club will break the mold and offer genuine insight into the lives of those bizarre creatures which surround us called"" teenagers. 
"" 
 ca n't hardly wait, however, does not. 
 instead, the writing/ directing team of harry elfont and deborah kaplan manages to take every clich? 
 found in the teenage genre, strip it completely of perception, intelligence and wit- and turn it into one of the most nauseating cinematic experiences i have ever been subjected to. 
 ca n't hardly wait follows a group of characters as they attend a house party on the night of their high school graduation. 
 the main characters are such perfected stereotypes that no analysis needs to be provided to perfectly understand them: there 's the average male protagonist preston( ethan embry), prom queen and cheerleader amanda( jennifer love- hewitt), football star mike( peter facinelli), white rapper wannabe kenny( seth green), computer geek william( charlie korsmo), and brainy outsider denise( lauren ambrose). 
 i could n't stand any of those characters. 
 whether it was william getting drunk and signing along to heavy metal songs or kenny proclaiming"" yo, i got ta have sex tonight!"", all i could think of was how elfont and kaplan possibly managed to con columbia pictures out of ten million dollars to fund their film. 
 apparently, ca n't hardly wait is supposed to be a comedy, but it tends to fail in this respect because of the fact that it 's not funny 
. 
 in all honesty, elfont and kaplan should be forced by their employers to attend remedial classes in humour.

"way of the gun is brimming with surprises, some good, most bad. 
 one of the good ones is ryan phillippe 's surprisingly halfway decent performance. 
 after the actor gained much attention by posing and preening through teen swill like i know what you did last summer, he hinted at a bit growth in last year 's cruel intentions with his amusingly contemptuous john malkovich meets james spader performance, though his acting in that film faltered around the third act mark, precisely when the screenplay made his character grow a heart( presumably to appeal to his training bra wearing fans) and start bellyaching about how he 'd fallen for his"" target"". 
 it was a dramatic shift that neither phillippe nor the film 's director could negotiate. 
 but he seems to be trying and that should n't be overlooked( or probably over praised) seeing as how, at this point, he really is n't required to do much but look pretty. 
 here, phillippe has procured a five day growth of beard, his hair askew and his affect altered to sound something like james cagney in all his"" look here, see"" glory. 
 it 's tough to believe a pretty boy like phillippe as a hard ass, but his performance actually helps with the illusion. 
 unlike ben affleck 's puppy dog approach in reindeer games, phillippe is believable and not too bad at that. 
 as for the plot, well, that 's one of the bad surprises; phillippe and the great benicio del torro play two moronic( and not even remotely likeable) criminals( introduced to us in the parking lot of a rave where they stupidly pick a fight with about twenty people) who hatch a scheme to kidnap a surrogate mother( juliette lewis) after overhearing that she 's carrying the baby of painter( scott wilson), a very well connected wealthy man.

"when critics attack seemingly well- intentioned films like patch adams or more recently pay it forward as i am about to do, their opinions are often greeted with a backlash of angry e- mails, sometimes even mock death threats from those who( i suppose) like to be shamelessly manipulated by their entertainment. 
 even politicians(!) tend to dismiss film critics as heartless cynics for occasionally dumping on good- hearted films while praising"" filth"" like pulp fiction. 
 these[ fill in the derogatory term that you are comfortable with] tend to forget that a film critic 's job is to review the movie, not the message, however sweet and endearing that message may be. 
 thusly patch adams is n't a bad film because it 's about a doctor who cares for his patients; it 's a bad film because it 's a calculated piece of brazen audience exploitation. 
 similarly while pay it forward may have its heart in the right place( though i even doubt that, stay tuned, an explanation is forthcoming), it 's still an unpleasantly maudlin mess. 
 the picture is about an emotionally guarded 5th grade history teacher( a somewhat similarly guarded kevin spacey), with a burn scared face and equally singed attitude, who gives his class the seemingly impossible assignment of doing one thing over the course of the semester that will change the world. 
 12 year old trevor( haley joel osmet), a disneyfied do gooder who takes care of his alcoholic mother( helen hunt), comes up with the notion to pay it forward; this entails a person doing one good deed( call it an uber favor) for three others, then telling them to do the same for three others and before long we 're all living in a frank capra movie.

"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy, the wedding singer. 
 unfortunately, that also has the effect of softening his edge. 
 he 's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore, not that it was much of one. 
 he 's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot. 
 the year is 1985, letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia. 
 adam sandler is nice guy robbie, the titular wedding singer, who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits. 
 robbie 's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee, linda( angela featherstone), leaves him at the altar. 
 however, things are looking up when he meets julia( drew barrymore), a waitress at the hall. 
 she 's the perfect woman, but for one small flaw: she 's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king, glenn( matthew glave). 
 so, most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love, and his attempts to stop the wedding. 
 as far as plots go, it 's a pretty thin and tired one. to fill the gaps, the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia. 
 from boy george to michael jackson, from miami vice to dallas, from the first cds to the last rubik 's cubes, this film revels in all the minutiae. 
 and then there 's the music. 
.. 
 learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank, and romy and michele 's high school reunion, this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow. 
 as a result, most songs get maybe a lyric or a half, but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes: the wedding singer vols.

"arriving in a barrage of hype, the blair witch project is one of the biggest box office success of the year. 
 however, like the golden child, although blair witch has made a lot of money, it 's not very good. 
 donahue, williams and leonard play themselves as three students who set out to make a documentary about the blair witch myth. 
 the film is made up of the camcorder footage they recorded, which means grainy footage and woozy camera angles. 
 although events start of normal, they get weird pretty quickly, while the threesome argue more and more as the journey goes on. 
 although an interesting premise, the blair witch project amounts to nothing more than a missed opportunity. 
 the biggest mistake the film makes is to let three mediocre actors the chance to improvise. 
 most of the dialogue is ad- libbed, and still manages to sound like a poor b- movie.

 it 's painfully idealistic, manipulative, and silly. 
 i did n't hate it -- it 's simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins; furthermore, most of the acting is quite good. 
 but i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved. 
 i can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct, and it 's pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams. 
 things start off in the predictable way, as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero, theo caulder( cuba gooding, jr.), an ambitious, young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced, old psychiatrist( donald sutherland). 
 caulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life, the one he thinks will make him famous. 
 the subject is ethan powell( hopkins), an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years. 
 powell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa, and it 's now caulder 's job to find out of he 's mentally competent enough to stand trial. 
 through a series of short sessions, caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell. 
 even though it really is an old man version of tarzan, much of this central idea is rather interesting. 
 as i said, hopkins is captivating for every second he 's on screen; he has a way of convincing us that he 's not acting, that he 's actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas.

"an attempt at florida film noir, palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels. 
 it 's slow moving, uninvolving, and plain just uninteresting. 
 harry barber( woody harrelson) is an ex- newspaper man, just out of jail after being framed for a crime. 
 his luck has n't been the best, but things are looking up when a mysterious woman, rhea malroux( elisabeth shue), approaches him with a proposition. 
 she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter, odette( chloe sevigny), pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get$ 500, 000 out of her stingy, but rich, husband felix( rolf hoppe). 
 at first, all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone, and to collect the money( of which he gets to keep 10%). 
 but, as the deed is carried out, things are not what they seem, and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm. 
 palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film, but the effect never quite comes together 
. 
 it 's got the sultry florida heat, seductive women, and even curvier plot twists, but the whole thing smells of paint- by- numbers. 
 sure, the right ingredients are there, but the end result is much too artificial. 
 a lot of the problems lie with the script, which, though providing some genuine surprises, is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations. 
 even the plot twists do n't seem to flow well with the rest of the story.

"you always have to be careful with the first official studio release out of the gate each year.

 diedre easily cons david 's not- so- bright new wife molly into believing she 's a child psychologist so that she can influence molly and 
 david 's quick- tempered son, michael. 
 diedre, at the same time, murders a bunch of people. 
 comments: the ex is a very bad movie. 
 i have n't seen a turkey of this magnitude in quite a while. 
 i kept vacillating, however, between giving the ex one star for its sheer awfulness and three stars for its campy humor( ultimately, i decided to split the difference and give it two stars). 
 as summarized briefly in the synopsis, this is yet another spurned- psycho- lover- gets- her- revenge type movie. 
 i 'm not sure how many films have been produced since fatal attraction which use this tired storyline, but it seems like 10, 000, 000, 000. 
 the ex, however, though following many of the standard cliches of this thriller subgenre, differs slightly from the norm in that, at least, it does n't take itself too seriously like so many other duds do( malicious and stalked are two examples which come to mind). 
 those involved in the movie realize they 're in a turkey, apparently, and turn in hammy performances which compliment the ludicrous dialogue contained within the script. 
 the ex 's storyline, as i said, incorporates many cliches predominant in films of its nature; however, 
 the plot is so overwrought and unbelievable 
 that, after a while, the viewer must accept that logic does not operate in the realm of the movie.

"the blues brothers was a wonderful film, a hilarious comedy packed with good music. 
 it cried out for a sequel, but john belushi 's untimely death seemed to eliminate the idea. 
 however, eighteen years have passed, and the long dormant sequel has finally emerged. 
 unfortunately, it 's a sequel not worthy of the original. 
 the film starts exactly eighteen years after the first one ended. 
 elwood blues( dan aykroyd) is just getting out of jail, his brother jake having recently died. 
 as in the first film, he first visits mother mary stigmata( kathleen freeman) and then sets about getting the band back together. 
 john belushi 's absence leaves a terrible hole in the film, and although three new characters are created to fill the void, it is still very noticeable. 
 first, there 's cabel( joe morton) the illegitimate son of elwood 's stepfather( played by cab calloway in the first movie). 
 cabel is reluctant to join his destiny, and spends most of the movie as an illinois sheriff, chasing the blues brothers band. 
 next, there 's mighty mack( john goodman), a bartender who becomes the new lead singer of the band. 
 finally, there 's buster( j. evan bonifant), a ten year old orphan who tags along with elwood and eventually joins the band. 
 the plotting of the film is hardly original... 
 it seems to be almost a clone of the original. 
 elwood has to go to reluctantly retrieve each member of the band, they then travel, while being pursued by the police, and perform at several odd stops until they finally reach the big concert finale. 
 the first film had neo- nazis as the random element, this time around, the russian mafia and a militia group fill their role.

"michael crichton has had a long career of writing novels, many of which are science fiction. 
 the most profitable film adaptation of any novel was an adaptation of a michael crichton science fiction novel.

 the film is expensive, over one hundred million dollars; is long, 133 minutes; has a terrific cast, including dustin hoffman, samuel l. jackson, and sharon stone; but has little that is really original and less that is exciting. 
 several years ago dr. 
 norman goodman( played by dustin hoffman) was asked to write up a set of procedures for the government to follow if an alien entity was actually encountered. 
 the plan he wrote was only semi- serious, but did explicitly define a team of experts who should investigate the alien. 
 now that team has been assembled by a mysterious team leader named barnes( peter coyote) to study a spacecraft almost a half mile in length that apparently dropped into the pacific ocean in the early 1700s.

 included in the team to investigate are mathematician harry adams( samuel l. jackson), biologist beth halperin( sharon stone), and astrophysicist ted fielding( liev schreiber) 
. 
 together they travel to the deep pacific spaceship to understand its secrets. 
 one major secret is the meaning of the huge sphere of gold- toned liquid metal at the heart of this spaceship.

 along the way, they find poacher paul sarone( jon voight), and become unwillingly embroiled in his quest to capture the elusive anaconda.

 at the beginning of anaconda, we find that flores and cale have had some kind of relationship in the past, but that seems to be more or less over now.

 cale chokes on a deadly wasp( do n't ask me how that happens- i do n't know) and is put out of action, relegated to being the person whom the rest of the film crew must get back to civilization for medical help. 
 this minimally helps to add a sense of urgency for the plot, since this goal now comes in direct conflict with sarone 's plan to capture the snake. 
 however, this is negated by the fact that cale seems to get better by himself about halfway through the film, and in any event still results in zero payoff from the relationship angle.

 the main difference between the giant snake in"" anaconda"" and the clown in a jack- in- the- box is that the clown is more realistic.

 ok so i laughed one time which warranted the 1/2 star, but other than that i sat in my seat wondering when this pos would be over,( which at a running time of 107 minutes seemed like forever!).

 let me be the first to say"" ready to rumble"" is a huge disappointment. 
 long time wrestling lovers( david and scott) dream of making it to the wcw, and watching jimmy king wrestle. 
 that is their hero of course, whom is kicked out of the wcw. 
 well here is where the plot thickens( lol): the two wish to rescue the king, and put him back into the wcw but not that easily, because they are being tampered with by many people who are out to get them, while david 's father wants him to become a police officer, and scott is a loser who has to with the help of david clean out johnny on the spots. 
 what a plot eh? 
"" ready to rumble"" is one of those films that tries to be funny, but 
 sadly fails miserably, everything in the film is imcomprehinsable, and even the trailer was n't funny. 
 the actors are dull, the script awful, and the plot which there is n't much of....

"plunkett& macleane marks the directing debut of jake scott, brother of ridley and tony. 
 naturally, this got me worried. 
 would jake 's talent be inherited from ridley or tony? if it was from ridley, than the movie would be a thoughtful suspensor with action thrown in. if it was from tony, it would be wham bang drivel. 
 unfortunately, the latter is true for this worthless picture with little charm. 
 carlyle and miller are the titular highwaymen, plunkett( carlyle) who is poor and unruly, and captain james macleane( miller) a clean cut gentleman.

 carlyle and miller are fun enough as the foul mouthed pair, although their characters are criminally undeveloped. 
 it appears that much of the money has been spent on the expensive looking sets and costumes, but not on the script.

 one of the neater touches that the movie brings in is that the only way he could make such an arrangement work was by ditching all of his childhood memories, but it 's only followed up on in a token fashion. 
 for his trouble, johnny gets chased by the yakuza, who seem to be the new bad guys in all the high- tech thrillers. 
 what 's funny is that if you watch gangster movies made* in* japan, there are whole gobs of details about genuine yakuza behavior and ethics, but of course there 's no room in this movie for any of that.

 it is a stupefyingly terrible film. 
 for the entirety of its running time, my eyes were attached to the screen, and i never once got bored. 
 i found the film interesting because of its unique awfulness: this is such a confused disaster of a film that it 's entertaining to watch it in the same way that it 's entertaining to witness a thirty car pileup on a freeway spaghetti bowl. 
 as a narrative, the big hit is pure garbage, never truly deciding its genre and constantly crossing all kinds of boundaries. 
 it reminded me a lot of grosse pointe blank, which is a similar film that fails in a lot of the same ways. 
 it 's fine to mix genres, if the film makers know what they 're doing. 
 unfortunately, writer ben ramsey and director kirk wong do n't seem to know how to handle the material, and the result is an action film that wants to be a comedy.

"when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain, you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie. 
 however, since this film also featured michael madsen, more than capable character actor, this time in the role of protagonist, the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt. 
 however, the very first scenes show 
 clear b grade action credentials 
- madsen plays richard montana, tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio( played by lynch). 
 however, the raid was only partially successful, and montana is getting the rap. 
 so, he begins his own private war against gio, trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt. 
 in the process, he meets gio 's mistress gina zamora( played by rosie vela) and starts relationship with her too. 
 although it does n't stink like many of the similar films can, inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine. 
 nobody in this film actually puts much effort, including madsen or lynch, and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke.

 apart from casting sherilyn fenn( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies, this film by ms.

"woody allen is one of the most successful artist- directors in hollywood, but he is becoming less and less reliable as a filmmaker 
. 
 in his early years of film- making he mastered the simple comedy. 
 from there he went into a second phase and took risks experimenting with different approaches and styles. 
 some of these work better than others. 
 zelig and crimes and misdemeanors are the work of a creative and intelligent artist. 
 deconstructing harry goes to the other extreme and is a bizarre experiment demanding more of the viewer than it gives back. 
 harry block( allen) has in his life only two drives. 
 he wants to have sex with as many women as possible and when he makes a mess of his life and those of his lovers he wants to retreat into his writing. 
 the story of this static and highly unsympathetic character is told with a number of often clumsy stylistic experiments. 
 perhaps the most irritating device is to express the disjointedness of harry 's life by editing harry 's scenes putting in cuts in the middle as if to show missing time with something edited out. 
 as a writer, harry puts his friends into his books in the thinnest of disguises. 
 the film dramatizes incidents from these supposed books and cuts between his real story line and fragments from harry 's books with different actors playing the real and fictional people in harry 's life. 
 these fragments are frustrating in their lack of completion, but even more frustrating is the bringing of the characters out of the fragments into scenes with the real characters. 
 it is up to the viewer to keep track not just who is fictional and who is real but also to keep straight who is the fictional doppelganger of which real person. 
 if that sounds complicated, it is. 
 then as another device in one of the stories, an actor seems to have the peculiar property that he has gone out of focus and can only be seen in blurry image. 
 harry sees this as a metaphor for his own condition and himself goes blurry for a short time.

"here 's a rarity: a children 's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject, is there a god? 
 done well 
, it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children 's cinema. 
 unfortunately, it is n't. with jumbled messages, and an unclear audience, wide awake was better left asleep. 
 fifth grader joshua beal( joseph cross) 
 is in the middle of a moral crisis. 
 his beloved grandfather( robert loggia) has died, and joshua has begun a quest. 
 he wants to find god, to discover why bad things happen. 
 this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents( dana delany and denis leary), but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths. 
 at his catholic school, his favorite teacher, sister terry( rosie o'donnell), tries to give him guidance, but this is a journey he must make on his own. 
 meanwhile, he is having the most momentous year of his life. 
 he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave( timothy reifsnyder), he gets his first crush, and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey. 
 it is somewhat confusing 
 as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be. 
 on its surface, it appears to be a kid 's film. 
 however, it deals with serious issues, and is likely to be boring for today 's instant- gratification kids.

"there 's no reason to doubt that donnie brasco is based, as its opening credits proclaim, on a true story. 
 but if it 's an accurate picture of life on america 's mean streets, than cinematic depictions of organised crime have had a much stronger basis in reality than i would have previously thought. 
 for from the film 's outset, when a group of hoods jocularly trade differing opinions on the merits of various automobiles( not unlike a number of movie lowlifes who recently gave a madonna song a close reading) donnie brasco resembles more than passingly a few gangster flicks once believed to be works of fiction. 
 our eponymous hero( johnny depp) is not the cheap crook he first appears to be. 
 brasco is joseph pistone, an undercover fbi agent who has the task of chumming- up to lefty( al pacino), a seasoned hood who tutors pistone in the art of being a"" wiseguy"". 
 regrettably, pistone learns his lessons all too well. 
 his concern for lefty, who is burdened with a heroin addicted son, exacerbates his own family troubles: his children resent his lengthy absences and his wife fears that her husband 's gangster persona is becoming a little too convincing. 
 true, the focus on pistone 's family life does deviate from the typical gangster- flick formula, but this subplot never rises above its television drama origins. 
 the unhappy couple trade predictable lines and engage in drawn- out domestic squabbles? including an ill- advised marriage guidance routine? 
 that slow the film down unnecessarily. the biggest problem with donnie brasco, however, is that its wiseguy attitude and style lacks the flair of its many predecessors. 
 the awkward use of an occasional disco tune momentarily reminds us its the 70 's, but not with the consistent and blindingly tacky style? 
 i loved those fluoro coloured suits? of scorces' costume drama casino.

"these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes. 
 but, only a few years ago, before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice, sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers. 
 sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south. 
 the way to regain popularity and prestige, they thought, was the use the same formulas, characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place. 
 one of such celebrity was eddie murphy, black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade. 
 in order to return to the spotlight, he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film, beverly hills cop, 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987. 
 seven years later, for the third instalment, he used the directorial service of john landis, another fading star, with whom he successfully collaborated twice- in trading places and coming to america. 
 this time, however, third time was n't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure. 
 eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback. 
 eddie murphy here plays axel foley, fast- talking streetwise detroit policeman, who raids illegal chop shop. 
 the routine police action ends in tragedy, when the criminals kill foley 's boss. 
 determined to bring the killers to justice, foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald( timothy carhart). 
 when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles, foley goes back to los angeles. 
 there, with the help of his old friend, local policeman rosewood( judge rheinhold), foley would clash with money counterfeit ring.

"" meet joe black"" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year, with a cinematography, music and cast that will dazzle most of us.

 then you 'll wait for something to happen for half an hour, but when you finally understand what 's going on, you 'll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins, brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this? 
 the script is simply a silly and unresolved story, which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture. 
 it feels like an eternity.

"keep cool, a chinese film directed by semi- accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang, was one of the kickoff films for this year 's hawaii international film festival. 
 on the day it premiered, lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block, some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater. 
 they need not have wasted their time. 
 the movie is billed as a comedy, but is surprisingly bereft of humor. 
 there are noticeable attempts at laughs, but very few tries actually click. 
 i wondered if there were jokes that i was n't getting because i 'm not from china, but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor could n't be attributed to the cultural barrier either. 
 keep cool just is n't very funny. 
 the prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool 's producer who, with the help of an interpreter, regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time, an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii. 
 although the print made it, the assistant 's luggage was lost. too bad that story was n't in the movie, because it got a big laugh.

"they should have stuck to the promise emblazoned on the original movie 's poster:"" no sequel. 
"" 
 scary movie 2 is nowhere near as funny as its predecessor, and it is not because the wayans brothers, shawn and marlon doing the writing and keenen ivory behind the camera, do n't try. 
 what defeats them is the genre they have chosen to spoof. 
 the first movie- an outrageous, low- brow, savage satire of teen slasher flicks such as scream 
 and i know what you did last summer- succeeded because of its take- no- prisoners attitude toward a type of film that was in vogue, familiar and popular. 
 in scary movie 2, the filmmakers take on the haunted house- ghost story format which, if you look at the grosses for such recent lame offerings as the respective remakes of the haunting and house on haunted hill, did not draw audiences nor enter the cultural psyche as did the various teen slasher series. 
 scary movie 2 does start off promising with a wonderful spoof of the exorcist, featuring james wood in the max von sydow role and veronica cartwright lampooning ellen burstyn. 
 of course split pea soup is the punch line- an overabundant amount, which offers the hope that the rest of the movie will be just as tasteless and excessive. 
 but this pre- credit sequence has nothing at all to do with the main action, which features the cast members from the original signing up to spend a weekend at a creepy haunted mansion as part of a university class project. 
 some of the jokes are as scatological and offensive as in the original, but they lack that take- no- prisoners bite that raised scary movie to the heights of burlesque.

 i 'd like to extend the same warning: watch out for skin deep, but whatever you do do n't watch skin deep.

 like any sensible wife, alex kicks zach out of the house and divorces him. 
 in response, zach goes on a spiritual journey of drinking, womanizing, psychotherapy, and self- discovery.

"jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons, an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities. 
 chan plays separated- at- births boomer and john ma, whose drastically different paths... 
 aw, forget the plot description, it 's not even worth the space. 
 but let 's face it. 
 no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway. 
 the scenes where nothing happens in chan 's films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together. 
 in the case of twin dragons, however, the tiresome plot- driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema),"" get to the good part already!"" most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers' efforts to hide the other 's existence from their own acquaintances. 
 why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained, but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot. 
 the twins' love interests, demure club- singer barbara( chan- film regular maggie cheung) and lusty bride- hopeful tammy( nina li chi), get disoriented in all the brouhaha, yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with. 
 the scenes describing the boys' bumbling antics get stretched so thin 
 we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot( in several shots, in fact, even the make- up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which.).

"the general 's daughter will probably be the cleverest stupid film we 'll see this year -- or perhaps the stupidest clever film. 
 it 's confusing to a critic when 
 so much knuckleheaded plotting and ostentatious direction shares the screen with so much snappy dialogue and crisp character interaction. 
 that, however, is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller. 
 the punched- up punch lines are ever on the verge of convincing you the general 's daughter has a brain in its head, even as the remaining 75% of the narrative punches you in the face with its lack of common sense.

 army 's criminal investigation division. 
 his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell( leslie stefanson) at a georgia base, the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation. 
 complicating the case is the fact that capt. 
 campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell( james cromwell), a war hero and potential vice- presidential nominee. 
 general campbell wants to keep the case out of the press, which gives brenner only the 36 hours before the fbi steps in.

 brenner begins uncovering dark secrets from the late captain 's past that make the case ever more sordid. 
 if only the sordidness were the worst of the general 's daughter 's problems. 
 scenes of sexual degredation do linger much longer than necessary, their negligible dramatic value overwhelmed by filtered- light sleaze. 
 director simon west likely thinks he 's covered himself by juxtaposing these images of violence with sweet flowers, but all he does is prove himself dependent on visual cliches, which is the film 's fatal flaw.

 the film is based on a"" mostly"" true story about a federal theater in the 1930s, that produced a play( the cradle will rock) that apparently was offensive to some, so the government shuts it down. 
 it 's during the time of the depression, and all this theater wants to do is entertain and cheer up those who do not have jobs, or are poor. 
 between this conflict lies what seems like 10 subplots, about those who work in theater, or those associated.

"blatantly borrowing elements from 1993 's"" like water for chocolate"" and 1991 's"" the butcher 's wife,"""" simply irresistible"" attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but, more often than not, comes off as laughable, leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar( t. v. 's"" buffy, the vampire slayer"") would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on. 
 things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda( sarah michelle gellar), a young woman who runs her late family 's struggling new york restaurant, runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air. 
 while out shopping, she also meets tom( sean patrick flanery), a charming, handsome man, who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for, and later when he decides to drop by her dive, called southern cross, for lunch, she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him, even though she is known to not be a very good chef. 
 suddenly, amanda finds her restaurant, on the edge of foreclosure, rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food, which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths. 
 are amanda and tom destined to be together? 
 and is it not just because of the magical food, but because they really, truly like each other? 
 and what exactly is going on with the food she is making? 
 does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation?

"i wo n't even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films.

 so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective: alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies 
 i was munching into after a hard day 's work. 
 i did n't just dislike it so much because the plot was awful; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing, but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning.

 200 years later, scientists' use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley- including the alien that was stuck inside her. 
 in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two; yet ripley is now not completely human, possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being. 
 i 'm sure someone can explain exactly why this is so, but for now we 'll just ignore it and move on. 
 why, you ask, would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated? 
 well, the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature. 
 these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research. 
 they 
( yawn) were wrong. 
 it does n't take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un- flossed teeth.

 review:"" pearl harbor"" is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art. 
 it is little more than a crassly- calculated attempt to woo the masses, enticing them with big stars, big effects, and a big setting -- but no heart. 
 it is difficult to criticise the actors, because they do everything the movie demands of them. sadly, 
 this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing"" pearl harbor"" with his left. 
 the plot here is pure cliche, and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop. 
 there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states, and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii. instead, there is just an assembly- line love triangle, some empty patriotic rhetoric, and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders( when one intones,"" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant"", i nearly fell out of my seat). 
 to the movie 's credit, it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself, an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war.

 morse turns out to be good, and a friendship slowly develops between the two, as their respective professions progress on the screen -- arkin 's teaching, and morse 's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists. 
 so far, my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue, and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack.

 i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was, with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy( billy crystal) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream. 
 and when sammy meets max, his giant, mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan, there is magic in the air; albeit it a bit goofy, i loved every minute of it. 
 the film, of course, plays on the size difference between the two, and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects.

 critique: an artsy- fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell, does n't really come together as a whole, with over- the- top symbolism, incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through. 
 in fact, this is n't so much of a realistic, articulate, behind- the- scenes look at the rise of a rock' n roll star, as it is an ambiguous, overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man, his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet.

 his new assignment is a bizarre one: the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband 's safe. 
 the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man, until the girl is brutally murdered.

"synopsis: original"" jurassic park"" survivor alan grant( neill) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby( macy and leoni) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur, to rescue their stranded son. 
 grant 's team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar, and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought. 
 review: there is one reason why"" jurassic park iii"" is better than its immediate predecessor,"" the lost world: jurassic park"". 
 the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life; 
 the former, only 94. 
 the first"" park"" was a marvellous film, full of awe- inspiring sights, interesting characters, and genuine thrills. 
 its two successors have been pale imitations, amounting to hundred- million- dollar b- grade horror movies. 
 at least this third entry realises it; whereas"" the lost world"" tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot,"" jurassic park iii"" simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin. 
 there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie; the computer- animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting, and even the first- time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation. 
 remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie? 
 nothing in this rehash even comes close. 
 add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman, payne and taylor, and phoned- in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni, and 
 it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts.

 when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed, it is not to service the character development, or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations, but to accommodate the convoluted plot. in a lightweight comedy, you might say, it is not required to have perfectly realized figures, just as long as they get the job done.

"when i ponder childhood memories past, one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the"" inspector gadget"" tv show with my older brother. 
 truth be told, we were rabid fanatics; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune, alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr. 
 claw, the inspector 's arch nemesis. 
 i was never a biggie on nostalgia, but you just ca n't help but have fond memories of something like that. 
 sometimes i even find myself up at 4 am watching re- runs of my favorite episodes, trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid. 
 at the very least, i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me. 
 despite how horrid a film may be, the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up. 
 so back i sat, with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver( let 's face it; exactly how good can a live- action disney film really be?). 
 i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr. 
 magoo and george of the jungle( two previous disney adaptations), 
 and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well 
. 
 rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness. 
 as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind, i was left sitting there, absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen

 can something this awful 
 truly exist in such an evolved world?

 written, directed, and produced by one of its two stars, stanley tucci, whose last picture was the indie smash hit, big night, the impostors almost never catches fire. 
 sputtering like a two- day old campfire, the story plays like an ad- lib sketch that was never polished or completed. 
 the film 's other star, oliver platt, was hilarious as the senator 's aide in bulworth. 
 the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent, including woody allen, steve buscemi, hope davis, alfred molina, campbell scott, lili taylor and tony shalhoub. 
 all are wasted save allen, who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes. 
( the audience will easily identify with allen 's sentiments.) with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror- imaged subtitles, the movie engenders little genuine laughter. 
 the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it. 
 the plot for the movie involves two starving actors, maurice( oliver platt) and arthur( stanley tucci), who accidentally end up on a cruise ship. 
 in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor( alfred molina), who is chasing them, they dress up as ship 's stewards. 
 the over- the- top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. 
 when the leads hide from their pursuers, arthur covers maurice 's mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze.

"the working title for no looking back was long time, nothing new, and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture. 
 even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes, it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics. 
 writer/ director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline, the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who has n't spent their life in seclusion. 
 instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings, burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion, offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way. 
 no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful. 
 the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide, and the sooner, the better.

 peeks of sunshine are few and far between.

 soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and, if not returned in four days, will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other.

 early on, during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt( tom cruise) and nyah nordoff- hall( thandie newton), woo works some of his trademark magic.

 the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to. 
 so why would n't the movie be wonderful to see. 
 simple, a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane. 
 the story of eva duarte( madonna), evita is full of drama that 's trapped inside by all the notes and chords. 
 she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker, then goes into the field of acting, and finally meets juan peron( price), the soon- to- be first president of argentina. 
 they fall in love and eventually marry. 
 sounds pretty good, does n't it. 
 well the story gets better, as eva goes on the"" rainbow tour"" across europe, trying to win respect. 
 eva duarte was a wonderful lady. 
 however, all of the drama- packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood. 
 i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring 
 and i left with happy, because i was right. 
 they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar. 
 although it did come off as dull, the beautiful cinematography is eye- catching, as was madonna 's performance. 
 as the"" spiritual leader of argentina,"" madonna would have definitely been an oscar- contender had she spoken a single line. 
 but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film. 
 do n't get me wrong and do n't look at my grade. 
 i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen.

"i have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas. 
 with the overt success of the three original star wars films, lucas has become, not necessarily a filmmaker, but the head cheeze at a huge toy company, with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve. 
 only this toy was made for$ 115 million, but every kid wants it, and, like all other expensive toys, falls apart within an hour after playing with it. 
 the product in question

 its about the money, baby! 
 no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it would n't make a ton of money before its fourth week of release. 
 i come to the sw franchise as a stranger, since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular.

"an affluent horse breeder 's past comes up to haunt him; an ages old cover- up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices. 
 that 's pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow

 that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source. 
 the acting in particular i found very good, the character development was also quite interesting but 
 alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie. 
 a few things about the story did n't sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover- up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone, yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better. 
 on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot. 
 the character 's aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing. as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener. 
 all these people acted their parts admirably, as for the part that sharon stone played, she played it well but the part was not utilized enough. 
 the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie, this is one of those occasions. 
 matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject( i myself would n't be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it).

"a fullyloaded entertainment review: website coming soon! 
 hunter s. 
 thompson 's fear and loathing in las vegas, written in 1971, is already an american classic; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post- psychedelia of the 1960 's, but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as"" gonzo"". 
 soon after the book was written, hunter s. 
 thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke. 
 and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas( the movie.) 
 although the book is one of my favorites, i now agree with thompson 's own assessment of the novel as"" unfilmable. 
"" 
 the main problem is that the book, although detailing wild drug use and tripped- out adventures, was not written on the road. 
 it was written and edited by hunter s. thomspons, relatively sober, at his home. 
 so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use, it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor. 
 hunter s. 
 thomspon, the narrator, while always drugged out, still has a grip on reality, and can still tell, with journalistic ability, what is going on around him. 
 not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas. 
 despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped, the movie is an exact duplicate of the book, in terms of dialouge. 
 unfortunately, this can get annoying, in the form of johnny depp 's( who plays thompson) excessive narration. 
 and the characters, while having vivid personalities, are played as 2-d characers on the screen: dr. 
 raoul duke( johnny depp 
, the name raoul duke was an alias of thompson 's) and his riding companion, dr.

"filmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull, dreary, and overused idea. 
 doug liman( swingers), director of the ultra- hip and severely dark comedy go, is an example of just such a filmmaker. 
 in his latest, he gives the viewers a raucous, neon- lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug- infested path of misadventure as director. 
 but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi- tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level, bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same. 
 his movie is produced anthology- style -- telling the same story from multiple( three) points of view, much as an author might write a serial novel. 
 consistent with this ethic, liman and screenwriter john

 regular drug dealer simon( desmond askew) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack( jay mohr) and adam( scott wolf) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal.

 max takes a liking to sheedy, and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax, owned by henrikson. 
 well, it does n't take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman, etc...

"gregg araki 's the doom generation was 
 possibly the very worst film ever made. 
 so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus? 
 first of all, some of the reviews were fairly positive. 
 also, the cast, consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up 
 ex 
 tv stars( including christopher knight, eve plumb, shannen doherty, and david leisure) was promising. 
 last of all, i wanted to give arraki one more chance. 
 i mean, the guy ca n't be that untalented, can he? 
 the answer to that question is three letters long. 
 nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles. 
 since arraki does n't know how to make anything coherent, it 's hard to describe the plot. 
 let 's just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend wo n't make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls. 
 the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star. 
 he turns out to be a nice guy who does n't care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans. 
 this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming. 
 it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki, and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez. 
 i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft. 
 he works better with the camera this time around, especially in the early scenes. 
 halfway through the film, i did n't necessarily find myself enjoying the film, but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation. 
 then as the movie went on, arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads, twisted sex games, and alien abductions. 
 it 's sad, because he almost actually had some decent material here, but he ruined it with his usual in your face

"sometimes, when i decide to write a short story or a poem, i think of a title first, and then think of a subject to go with it. 
 it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence. 
 i would n't be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits, and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it. 
 the title sequence is so good, so ominous and original, that it had me engrossed before the picture even began. 
 of course, my attention dwindled shortly into the film. 
 disturbing behavior, like so many thrillers, starts off interesting and ends up 
 laughably ridiculous. 
 it 's a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex. 
 it 's a suspense film with no suspense. 
 it 's an evil small town story with no story to speak of. 
 it 's a disaster, a listless and uninspired disaster, that just barely misses one- stardom because of a few good sequences, a mercifully short running time, and one terrific set of opening credits. 
 our main man is a fellow named steve clark, blandly played by jimmy marsden. 
 he moves to a small town with his family after, tragically, his brother shoots himself. 
 steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother; we learn this through strange home- video like nightmares that he has occasionally. 
 the big trial for steve is, of course, to fit in at school and make new friends. 
 marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail, so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject. 
 as a social reject, he falls in with some pretentious dope- smoking philosophers, gavin( nick stahl) and rachel( katie holmes).

 though the original film, released last year, was watchable enough, this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater 's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout. 
 jennifer love hewitt is a very good- looking young leading lady; however, unlike neve campbell, hewitt struggles with acting. 
 she just is n't convincing in this film( and she was n't in the original either). 
 this puts many young males, including myself, in a paradoxical quandary: she 's very attractive, but the annoying, spoiled, valley girl- type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize, exploitatively, her figure.

 a favourite book of mine called the golden turkey awards relates the story that when mommie dearest was unleashed upon unsuspecting audiences back in 1981, paramount soon realised they had a problem on their hands. 
 it was n't just the film 's disappointing box office performance. 
 indeed, in the coming years some people would be going back to see it two, three, even six times. 
 no, the main problem was that what was intended as a serious biopic of screen queen joan crawford was turning into the laugh riot of the year. 
 in a desperate attempt to capitalise on this unexpected turn of events, some publicity hacks dreamed up outrageous print advertisements screaming:"" mommie dearest: the biggest mommie of them all!"". 
 executives at paramount were appalled and soon had the ads withdrawn, but it was all too late. 
 mommie dearest was already cementing its place in camp cinema history. 
 unfortunately, faye dunaway 's energetic, at times ridiculously over- the- top performance is about the film 's only redeeming feature. 
 based on daughter christina crawford 's trashy biography, mommie dearest chronicles a series of mainly private events in the life of her moviestar mother. 
 if you believe this movie, it was a life was racked by obsession, lonliness, child abuse and rampant egomania. 
 the film begins with crawford adopting two children, and concludes in the office of her lawyer where her now grown- up daughter and son find out they have been left out of their mother 's will. 
 joan always wanted her kids to be able to fend for themselves, you see. 
 but that 's about the only thread in the narrative that manages to survive to the film 's end. 
 the script- laboured over by four writers, a bad sign in itself- is a poorly connected series of episodes that builds little dramatic momentum.

 they graduate high school, join the military, and then, rather curiously, decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet.

 jonathan trager( john cusack) and sara thomas( kate beckinsale) both go for the same pair of gloves.

 jonathan falls hard, and sara is charmed. when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper, a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand. 
 she takes this as a sign from fate that they should n't be together; jonathan is flabbergasted. to pacify him, she comes up with an idea: jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill, which she will promptly spend.

"i did n't come into city of angels expecting greatness. 
 i 've never seen wim wenders' wings of desire, the classic movie upon which city is loosely based. 
 then again, i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device, with the little mermaid( both the disney version and the original folktale) being among them, that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold. 
 unfortunately, city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them. 
 the plot, for those that could n't tell from the previews, revolves around the angel seth, played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage, who, in the midst of his angelic duties, falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally). 
 of course, his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her, watch her buy groceries, only to disappear in the blink of an eye. 
 their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human. using this framework as a jumping- off point, the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire, the joys of being human, and the definition of perfection. 
 the first half of the movie succeeds on most points. 
 cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who does n't know feelings so ca n't really express, preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang- dog expressions. 
 unfortunately, cage takes the intensity too far sometimes, and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive. 
 as maggie, ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right. 
 her beauty, unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss, is mature, intelligent, and winning.

 there are just so many problems with this movie that it 's hard trying to figure out where to start. 
 first of all, i guess, is the setting. 
 the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas, other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting. 
 exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james( jennifer love hewitt, one of the only survivors of the first film) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up? 
 the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through.

 from the surface` patch adams' looks very promising. 
 it 's a story about a not so young man, patch adams( robin williams), who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people. 
 when the film opens, we find patch, depressed and suicidal, checking himself into a mental hospital. 
 in a few scenes, strongly reminiscent of` one flew over the cuckoo 's nest,' he ends up helping the patients through their problems; and it 's here that he finds how much he loves working with people. 
 so he checks himself out of the hospital, and heads straight to medical school. 
 right from the start, patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable. 
 he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry. 
 shortly after joining medical school, he meets and falls in love with carin( monica potter). 
 they, along with patch 's dork friend, truman( daniel london), start a medical clinic for uninsured people.

 this does not come as a surprise, since the studio that made it is warner brothers, who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other. 
 jack frost( michael keaton) is a struggling middle- aged rock musician who loves his wife, gabby( kelly preston), and 11-year- old son, charlie( joseph cross), but does n't spend nearly enough time with them.

 when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died, the snowman outside the house is taken over by jack 's spirit. 
 jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him, but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise.

"my son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies. 
 we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills, the corny dialog, the ludicrous premises and the bad acting.

 this movie slaps you with conception, pregnancy, delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames, without pausing for infancy.

"it seemed like the perfect concept. 
 what better for the farrelly brothers, famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter, than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality?

"what hath kevin williamson wrought? 
 while the horror movie revival spurred on by his_ scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_, 
_ halloween: 
_ h20_, and 
_ 
 scream_2 
_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films. 
 those williamson- less post-_scream_ efforts, among them_ wishmaster_ and the recent_ disturbing_behavior_, have been frightening all right -- 
 frighteningly, insultingly_ bad_ 
. add to that list 
_ urban_legend_, which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy. 
 the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas. 
 first, the opening sequence, like that of_ scream_, is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling. 
 this sequence, in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini( natasha gregson wagner) is decapitated while driving, also reveals the other obviously williamson- esque touch: the killer 's look. 
 dressed in a large hooded parka, wielding an axe, the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the_ i_know... 
_ fisherman, sans the hook. 
 one thing horta does not borrow from williamson, however, is the intriguing premise. 
 students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends -- those contemporary bits of"" mythology"" passed from person to person, group to group, year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness. 
 it hardly matters if they are true or not, such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi( he did n't). 
 michelle, slain by the"" killer lurking in the backseat"" of lore, is but 
 the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true; as the body count rises, fellow pendleton student natalie( alicia witt) suspects not only a link between the murders, but a personal link to her past",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its predictable plot and lack of originality. The reviewer also finds the movie's premise promising but poorly executed, and criticizes the movie's killer for being too similar to other horror movie villains.",0.24522025164333172
"warner brothers has scored another marketing coup. 
 the one- two punch was started in the summer, with the release of batman forever. 
 trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat, ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel. 
 carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever- wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video($ 11. 
 99 at wal- mart); a mere two weeks before carrey 's return in this marketwise, but misfired comedy. 
 ace ventura: when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber- faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment. 
 he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher, in batman forever, but, here, left to his own devices, carrey quickly wears out his welcome. 
 the opening sequence is by far the best -- an amusing spoof of cliffhanger, with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon. 
( you can guess what happens to mr.

 the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas, and then to not- so- darkest africa, where ace is on the case of a missing white bat.

"synopsis: wealthy cuban landowner luis( banderas) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride. 
 not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia( jolie), she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit. 
 soon, julia has absconded with both luis' fortune and his heart, and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld, luis begins to realise that, for him, there is no turning back. 
 review: 
 given the absurdism of its would- be plot, it 's unlikely that"" original sin"" could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking, regardless of writer, director or stars. 
 this is, at its heart, b- movie junk: a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions. 
 that said,"" original sin"" could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it. 
 instead, cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production, and directs it as such. 
 the result is a vapid, uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses, as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill. 
 consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie: brightly- lit and mostly filmed from above, 
 it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show. 
 cristofer does n't even manage to capture the allure of cuba; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy, sensuous island paradise, it appears bland and lifeless. at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script, but are n't being given the chance. 
 the same can not be said of jane, whose billy is nebbish and transparent. 
 also unwise is the jolie framing sequence, which practically gives away the film 's denouement.

"when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart, it could mean one of two things: that the recently overworked individual is due for a well- deserved rest, or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence. 
 the latter 's the case with john mctiernan and"" the thirteenth warrior,"" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring' 98 opening- and fast on the heels of mctiernan 's"" the thomas crown affair"" remake, a flick that got good reviews.

 reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton, whose"" eaters of the dead"" novel provides"" warrior 
"" 's source( and its initial title), this messy melange of culture- clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish- sorta like"" braveheart"" without any of the passion. 
 but the bloodshed certainly remains: there 's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills, though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness. 
 these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside. 
 the good guys are loud, crude, often unintelligible and- judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot, which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador( antonio banderas) who tags along quite reluctantly.

" 
 the red violin"" is a cold, sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached. 
 it 's a movie that seems almost clinical, as it traces the 300-plus- years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title. 
 opening in the 17th century, the story shows how violin- maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son. 
 but when tragedy strikes, the violin becomes the personification of its maker 's grief. 
 from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery. 
 again, tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph. 
 we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in mao 's communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz( samuel l. jackson), who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity. 
 the violin becomes morritz 's obsession, just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it. 
 morritz, however, is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creator 's intention. 
"" 
 the red violin"" could have been a touching, inspirational story, as soaring as a beethoven symphony. 
 however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer. 
 here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact. 
 girard, for some unknown reason, uses mostly master shots, keeping his camera- and thus us- at a distance. 
 we get no feel for the miracle 
 that is the violin. 
 it 's resonance, its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression. 
 nor are any of the performances memorable.

 well, said"" squad"" certainly wo n't be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else, maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards. 
 a contemporary take on this decidedly' 70s show does n't exactly seem unwarranted, but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf did n't transform into a full- blown case of botulism. 
 how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad, insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time. 
 they are julie, pete and linc, reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd( exposition put out of the way so fast that you 're likely to be lost from the opening moments on), and they are respectively played by claire danes, giovanni ribisi and omar epps, talented actors each deserving of better than this. 
 their plight involves standard cop- corruption stuff, as our would- be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover- up after their superior( reliable dennis farina, one of the best things here and gone so quickly) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking.

"ready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film; i have a problem even regarding it as a film. 
 it 's more of a show, a big commercial for ted turner 's world championship wrestling( wcw). 
 the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page, goldberg, and sting.

 they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities. 
 the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young molly 's house and creates every wish she wants. 
 now it 's up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one. too bad really that this is a bad movie, surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing, the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between.

 it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby.

 sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show, but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out. 
 ephron has him do this so that annie reed( meg ryan) can hear it. 
 annie is a happy woman. 
 she is engaged to walter, an allergy- prone working man and seems to be perfectly content. 
 but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show, she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it. 
 five years after this movie hit theaters, hanks, ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better, although still sub- par romantic comedy you 've got mail, which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet. 
 at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity. 
 here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five. 
 the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory.

"if you 've seen the trailers or commercials, it 's rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store. 
 well, it 's hard to tell after watching the movie as well. 
 bruce willis is a resident of the future, and it is a rather bleak future. 
 the world 's population had disintigrated into a mere 200, 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals. 
 the reason? in 1995, an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus, thus wiping out practically the world 's population in a mere month. 
 bruce willis' character is one of the surviving few, but is enslaved by scientists, as are most of last living humans. 
 they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task: go into the past, find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys, and kill him. 
 well, this explanation did n't come easy. 
 although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people, our future and the evilo in the world, as a story it is very confusing. 
 and dragging. 
 i know a movie isn''t keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that it 's only been an hour passed. 
 terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate, and i have n't watched his previous work brazil, but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out, you wish it were more complex, and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me.

 directed by william malone, written by dick beebe,"" house on haunted hill"" initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie- like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible. 
 one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck. 
 a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water. 
 these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b- horror flicks, with grunting noises and cadaverous movements. except this time, at the end of the millenium, the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be. 
 in past horror films, the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims. 
"" house on haunted hill"" does n't want their audience to have an imagination, everything is provided for them to watch and squirm, not think. 
 this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film. 
"" house on haunted hill"", which is based on the 1958 film of the same title, introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can, following the opening blood fest. 
 the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot. 
 the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling, unexpected shots of blood, guts, and mayhem. however, 
 the film is neither scary nor unpredictable. 
 the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner( geoffrey rush).

 as the parrot, mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up. 
 benny, on the other hand, is a character you 've seen a thousand times before, and mohr brings nothing new to that role.

" 
 the beach"" is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder. 
 every forty minutes of this two- hour film begins with a new theme, virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act. 
 it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment. 
 but then in the second act, the mood of the film abruptly changes 
 and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of"" blue lagoon"".

 the main character of"" the beach"" is angst- ridden richard( leonardo dicaprio). 
 he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if you 're looking for a good time. 
 richard 's voice- over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown.

 he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy( robert carlisle).

 there is no great demand for another giant ape movie- make that ape movie, period.

 and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable, it 's also an assembly line product through and through, lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it.

"i can imagine how good krippendorf 's tribe must have looked on paper. 
 it does not surprise me in the least that a group of extremely talented actors, led by the great richard dreyfuss and a good director( todd holland), all wanted to make this film. 
 in fact, it is only the expertise by which this excruciatingly bad script has been executed that keeps me from suggesting that you stay as far away from krippendorf 's tribe as possible. 
 in retrospect, i can imagine how bad this film could have been. 
 i shudder at the possibilities of awfulness 
 had it starred an actor less able than dreyfuss. 
 dreyfuss plays james krippendorf, an anthropologist who is granted$ 100, 000 by his university to find an undiscovered tribe in new guinea. 
 halfway into his two- year expedition, his wife( apparently) dies. 
 i say apparently because when or how she dies is never truly established. 
 later, we find out that much of the grant money was spent on big- screen tvs and other such pleasures. 
 so, when krippendorf finds out what happens to professors who do not use their grant money wisely, he decides to construct an elaborate lie. 
 he makes his own tribe, using his three children as actors in a video. 
 he simply makes up certain incredible facts about this tribe( which he calls the shelmickedmu). 
 audiences at krippendorf 's lectures are amazed by his findings that the shelmickedmu practice circumcision. 
 and proof that the typical family unit is led by a single father is truly amazing to the anthropological community. 
 like all films like this, the lie becomes more and more complex, and the suspense is generated with us wondering at what point it is all going to fall out from under our hero. 
 dreyfuss is a funny, talented man, and he is funny in this film. 
 he has lots of positive energy and, unlike most comical actors, really manages to play people like this realistically.

"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors, mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball. 
 fiercely unoriginal, director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him. 
 there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind. 
 the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars. 
 the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13. 
 interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001: a space odyssey. instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie, de palma stops right there, refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart. 
 mission to mars takes it 's first wobbly steps at a pre- launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done. 
 during these surface scans of the characters, we learn that jim mcconnell( sinise) has lost his wife. 
 it 's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety. 
 the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability. 
 there is no contentiousness, no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time. 
 maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff, but in that movie, the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects. 
 it 's the year 2020 and this is nasa 's first manned excursion to the red planet. 
 a crew, led by luke graham( cheadle), arrives on mars and quickly discovers an anomaly, which they investigate with tragic results.

 congratulations, you now have all the necessary requirements to fully enjoy a whole lot of nothing. 
 some movies fail at the box office but you manage to see why the producers thought it could have been a good movie, others are simply good ideas that are badly executed. 
 then there 's playing god, which enters the esteemed category of movies which seem to have grown from the union of a drunk director, actors satisfied in the knowledge that this horrible flick will have no lasting impact on their careers and a bunch of rip- offs 
( or homages as they like to call it) from other, better movies that end up looking like an unflushed toilet. 
 harsh? 
 maybe. 
 justified? 
 hell yes! 
 this is a movie that is not just satisfied in ripping off other movies but feels the need to remind us of that fact every ten minutes.

 two guns blazing!

"preposterous religious action film( produced by the trinity broadcasting network) about a code hidden within the text of the bible that when deciphered will lead to the end of the world( nice of those bible authors to put a doomsday code into the most read book ever eh?). 
 michael york plays a millionaire diplomat who breaks the code and sets out to become god on earth and fulfill the doomsday prophecies, while casper van dien( terribly miscast and giving an awful performance as a result) plays the atheist motivational speaker who must stop him. 
 michael ironside( great as always, despite the silly film surrounding him) plays a fallen priest and right hand man to michael york 's character. 
 here 's some subtle character development you may have missed pertaining to ironside 's character. 
 now despite the fact that we see him murder a man in the opening scene, the filmmakers are n't quite sure if their audience will understand that he is evil. 
 how do they fix that? make specific efforts to show that his character is the only one in the film who smokes! 
 there are lots of ominous shots of michael ironside smoking... 
 oooooo scary. 
 but even that was n't enough for the filmmakers apparently, as they later have to infer that ironside 's character is gay! 
 it comes out of nowhere and just makes no sense.

" america 's sweethearts"" has an intriguing premise and a great cast, but it is n't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be. 
 almost all the problems with the project can be traced back to co- script writer billy crystal, who shows the same lack of discipline with the screenplay that he typically displays while co- hosting"" comic relief"" charity shows with robin williams and whoopi goldberg( 
 two other paragons of self- indulgence). 
 crystal ignores a simple, but crucial, rule: for a screwball comedy to work, the characters must be placed into a rigid social setting, because only in that context will their unorthodox antics be humorous. 
"" 
 america 's sweethearts"" takes place at a press junket, where decorum must be maintained in front of the reporters. 
 it 's a promising set- up, but the screenplay quickly blows off the rules, thus dissipating the tension of the situation. 
 by the end of the film, all the lead performers participate in a huge fight with a room full of journalists looking on, but their outbursts are only mildly amusing because the structure has been destroyed. 
 john cusack and catherine zeta- jones play eddie thomas and gwen harrison, a beloved acting duo whose marriage hit the skids when gwen began seeing hector( hank azaria), a spanish actor with an ego almost as pronounced as his lisp.

 these treats are great relief from the summer heat. 
 in contrast, this film made me simmer in disappointment. 
 i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat. 
 this was true of star wars episode i, but at least in that film, the story and the characters were still in the back seat. 
 in this film, they are no where to be found. 
 what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats, lots of female extras who look like can- can dancers, and a clunky, 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula. 
 two men are asked to stop this threat. 
 one is artemus gordon( kevin kline), an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents. 
 among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest. 
 the other man is jim west( will smith), who prefers the shoot- first- then- shoot- some- more method of investigating. 
 although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success, their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate, two- man vaudevillian act.

( it involves hiring special impersonators) by two cons in order to fool harry, a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post. 
 when the' kidnapped' odette is found dead, the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/ murderer, and the police are hot on harry 's trail.

"starring arnold schwarzenegger; danny devito; emma thompson& frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment, and a big one at that. 
 junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman. 
 these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins. 
 so foolish me, i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins.

 still believing that their drug will work, they decide to test it anyway, on hesse. 
 so, dr. 
 hesse( schwarzenegger) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug. 
 their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying, surely it will work on a woman.

 the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel 's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision. 
 brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it, and the opening scenes tap into it a little. 
 then it goes nowhere with that idea. 
 there is perhaps one rather fleeting scene afterwards that deals with the potential trauma of this dehumanization, and the rest of the film is just some of the biggest action movie cliches 
 i 've ever seen. 
 the whole idea of the inhuman, soldier- type character gaining some degree of humanity by defending a potential female love interest and family from his evil counterpart out to kill her is done, and it 's been done much better. 
 i was able to predict the plot of the_ whole_ story, which would n't be so bad if other aspect of the film somewhat interesting. 
 between the action sequences, it tries to deal with the aforementioned issues of humanity through the performance of mr. 
 russel in the film and the tiny little window to his soul that is his eyes, since 
 his dialog is extremely limited. 
 his performance in that way is n't all that bad, but certainly is not enough to carry this film. 
 other performances in this film are really not worth much mention at all, and they generally are about as weak as their characters. 
 but enough of this stuff about plot and character, right? is n't the most important part of an action film, well, the action? 
 even in this aspect the film is a disappointment. 
 in mortal kombat( 1995), director paul anderson proved that truly engaging use and choreography of action in a film can override problems with plot and produce something entertaining. however, 
 he fails to repeat that in this film.

"the first scene of operation condor has jackie chan preparing for a secret mission. 
 he attempts to pop a couple of pieces of chewing gum into his mouth, but misses. 
 after they ricochet off his face, he says,"" not a good start. 
"" 
 as it turns out, this line not only gives foreshadowing to the opening sequence, but to the rest of the movie as well. 
 in this, the latest of the jackie chan movies to be released in america after first runs in hong kong, chan plays an international operative codenamed"" condor"", and is tasked by the united nations with finding a stash of gold hidden at a secret base by the nazi 's during their retreat across the saharan desert during the second world war. 
 for some reason, condor is given his mission at the u. s. 
 embassy in spain. 
 i think this may have been done so that in a chase scene, they could honor the time old tradition of knocking over a fruit cart. 
 watch for it in any chase scene set in a foreign country, most notably in europe. 
 the chase will take itself through a marketplace, and a fruit cart will be overturned. 
 it 's almost a guarantee. 
 anyway.... condor is given a key which is supposed to unlock a giant vault in which the gold is hidden; the problem is that the key has insulators integrated into it, which may mean a booby trap might be electronically triggered if the key is used improperly. 
 to help him figure out where the gold is hidden and how to use the key correctly, condor is accompanied by a desert expert( carol cheng) and the granddaughter of the captain who was in charge of hiding the gold( eva cobo).

"cashing in on the success of white men ca n't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles( including the cowboy way and drop zone), wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed, hoping that they can strike up the same success. 
 sadly, if this dismal, cliche ridden and mind- numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by, they have n't got a chance in hell of even coming close.

 following several run- ins with their tyrannical boss( robert blake), who is obsessed with the"" money train"" --a train which carries all the subway 's takings -- and will let nothing stop it 
( now* there 's* an original plot device), harrelson 's character decides to try and take off with the cash. 
 along the way, both of them fall in love with the same woman -- another transit cop who also hates her boss. 
 this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard(' you were always the better brother' etc.

 given a better script, better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time( the film almost went for two hours -- or did it just feel like it?) 
, this film might( and i mean* might*) have turned out okay, but as it is, 
 it is stocked with the worst action film cliches, whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time.

"girl 6 is, in a word, a mess. 
 i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film. 
 there was no sense of where the film was going, or any kind of coherent narrative. 
 if there was a point to the film, i missed it. 
 girl 6, by the way, is the way theresa randle 's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace; all the girls are known by their numbers. 
 the plot, such as it is: theresa randle is a struggling n. 
 y. actress, and eventually takes a job as a phone- sex operator. 
 she begins to lose contact with reality, as her job consumes her. 
 also, she must deal with the advances of her ex- husband( isiah washington). 
 he is an ex- con thief, and she tries to keep him away, while at the same time, it 's clear that she still harbors feelings for him. 
 her neighbor, jimmy( spike lee) functions as the observer; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6. 
 he also functions as a point of stability, as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex. 
 the soundtrack, consisting of songs by prince, was jarring. 
 it kept taking my attention from the film- not altogether a bad thing, i 'll grant you, as what was transpiring onscreen was n't that riveting. 
 for parts of the middle of the film, the music stayed blissfully in the background. 
 in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film, however, the music was particularly loud and distracting

"back in 1980s, chuck norris used to be synonym for the action films. 
 he could n't, of course, top the success and fame of big action names like sylvester stallone or arnold schwarzenegger, but sheer quantity of his films guaranteed that he was household name among shoot'em up and beat'em up genre aficionados. 
 that quantity was mostly provided by cannon group, prolific production company that dominated the b- movie market in previous decade by flooding it with cheap, formulaic and, more often than not, unwatchable genre products. 
 the hitman, 1991 action thriller directed by chuck 's brother aaron, is one of the last among them. 
 chuck norris here plays seattle cop betrayed, shot and left for dead by his partner( which should n't surprise anyone, considering the fact that the partner is being played by michael parks, specialised for roles of usually very mean characters). 
 surviving the shooting, cop is pronounced dead and hired as deep undercover agent. 
 he infiltrates the underworld circles in seattle and becomes their top hitman, using his abilities to start brutal war between three major crime organisations- italians, french canadians and iranians. 
 since it is rather absurd to expect great acting ability from chuck norris, at least not in this kind of movie, the biggest attraction of this film should have been action. 
 well, the action in this film falls flat- it is boring, repetitive and not at all exciting. 
 it is nothing more than monotonous series of scenes 
 that contains violence too brutal even for this type of films. 
 we know very little about norris' character while, on the other hand, gangsters are portrayed with more human dimension. 
 in the end we almost feel sorry for them, since they are shown totally powerless against norris and his unstoppable and bloody crusade. 
 during the film, somebody obviously became aware of that problem, so the screenwriter introduced the subplot dealing with the black boy who gets adopted by norris. 
 that caused another problem- any questions about nature of that relationship had to be quashed with another subplot",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer found the action in the film boring and repetitive.

"how do you judge a film that is so bad, but intentionally so? 
 in spiceworld, the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal: mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it. 
 if that was their goal, they did a fantastic job. 
 so is it fair to give it such a low grade when it was n't really meant to be much better than this? 
 honestly, i 'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades, 
 so does that mean i graded it inaccurately? 
 truth be known, i do n't really think i can answer this question. 
 to understand spiceworld, you have to understand the spice girls. 
 unless you 're very 
* very* young, or fairly older, you probably have at least heard of them. 
 they 're a group of five busty british babes who 've had# 1 hit singles and whose debut album sold millions. 
 they 're primarily adored by pre- teen girls who hope someday the contents of their training bras might match those of ginger spice 's( real name: geri haliwell) wonderbra.

 she 's a lightweight.

 she may give a stronger performance than, say, keanu reeves in a walk in the clouds, by not by much. 
 beyond rangoon is a very physically appealing film, thanks to the practiced craftsmanship of john boorman( deliverance, excalibur, hope and glory). 
 he keeps the narrative moving, 
 no matter how muddy the story -- or the heroine -- gets. 
 why he chose arquette remains a mystery, though. 
 maybe he was thinking that the dramatic weight of the story would overcome any casting deficiencies.

 for five years,"" the x- files"" television show has developed a dedicated fan culture, whose rabid devotion to the series rivals that of"" star trek"" fans.

"i can see a decent sports movie struggling to break free of oliver stone 's` any given sunday'. 
 it 's an entertaining movie that offers both insight and excitement into the rock- em, sock- em profession of pro football. 
 unfortunately, the director seems to have only one priority on his mind: sprucing up the film with an assortment of fancy camera maneuvers. 
 in altering each frame with quick- flash photography and dizzying, in- your- face editing, stone appears to have completely ignored the matter of plausible character development and football politics.

 joseph cross( joshua beal) is a 10-year- old who is saddened by the recent loss of his grandfather( loggia) to bone marrow cancer. 
 loggia is wonderful in relating to the child in such a wholesome manner, it almost saves this film from drowning in syrup. 
 the beals are like a sitcom idyllic family, where everyone is just so nice and affluent, and properly religious without being fanatical. 
 the beals, the father( denis leary) and his wife( dana delany), are both successful doctors; julia stiles plays joshua 's older sister, needling her younger brother but also showing that she really cares about him. 
 this is a family seemingly conceived in heaven, but living in south philadelphia, sending their children to a well- run catholic school. 
 joshua, the protagonist and the narrator of this yarn, is a handsome, sweet, intelligent, friendly, and endearing child, who does well in school, relates to the nuns and priests, and talks politely to his well- meaning parents. 
 all this mawkish interplay makes it almost too nauseating to watch. 
 the plot arises when joseph has a problem coping with the death of his beloved grandfather, who promised to be with him forever. 
 his answer is to search for god, pretty heady stuff for a youngster his age to do, but that 's just the way it is, sometimes.

 i am not saying that this is n't possible..

 there was one scene that should have been short... 
 but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking..

 there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do... 
 things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort

 another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning. 
 this movie is also very predictable... 
 you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment.. 
 granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you. 
 also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated... 
 it gets boring at times to tell you the truth... 
 even though there is still action going on. 
 another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero.

 directed by vicky funari as a labor of intense love- she spent the last one third of her life on film- the movie blends documentary footage with historic and fanciful recreations to relate the bitterly sad and true story of paulina cruz suarez. 
 paulina was a maid in vicky 's household when vicky was young. 
 i got to learn the film 's background when i attended a screening in which the two women who made it were present. 
 for those without such context, the reaction to the film may be that it is a parody of a bad indie film. 
 the acting is amateurish, the story is maudlin, and it has all the visual appeal of a bad home movie. grainy and overexposed, the movie 
, shot on 16 mm film and videotape, has little to recommend it. 
 confusingly composed, the movie jumps about jarringly as it tells its story. 
 quite bloody at times, the story, full of horrific images, seems designed to shock and repulse us. 
 why else would you include a scene with a completely nude and bloody 8-year- old paulina? 
 another scene has a teenage paulina being fondled on a bus by the man sitting next to her. 
 in retaliation, she bites off part of his finger. 
 this covers the both of them in a bucket of blood.

"in this year 's summer movie preview issue of_ 
 entertainment_weekly_, theresa connelly described her writing- directing debut,_ polish_wedding_, as"" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would. 
"" 
 one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film, a comedy- drama that 
 appears doomed at its most basic elements. 
 the family at the center of_ polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks, which consists of mother jadzia( lena olin), father bolek( gabriel byrne), sole daughter hala( claire danes) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness. 
 it 's a large family, but there 's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch, certainly not in the primary trio. 
 jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family, but she 's kind of a hypocrite since she 's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija). 
 her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek, who is such a passive wimp that one can not connect with his sadness and frustration. 
 also, how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy, sexy jadzia? 
 hala is a spoiled, self- centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy. 
 with such an unappealing set of characters, it 's no surprise that_ polish_wedding_ 's plot complications are far from involving. 
 naturally, jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop, russell schuster( adam trese), who fathered the child, but he refuses to make such a commitment. 
 ho- hum. 
 another complication, involving the decidedly un- virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary, is first played for laughs and then, 
 inexplicably, as a profound statement in the film 's climax -- which, ironically, is funnier than any of the film 's lame attempts at humor, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell.

"several days after having seen this movie, i 'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest, a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate, found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes. 
 this is a dreadful motion picture? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs- to- jokes ratio

 there 's a kind of desperation in the movie 's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is; the manic style betrays itself as a last- ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script. 
 the premise does n't sound especially amusing to begin with? 
 almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers, the effeminate leslie edwards( matthew perry) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt( chris farley), who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest. 
 edwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies( albeit of the early-19th century variety), including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages( none of which prove to be useful), a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest, and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries. 
 along the way, the intrepid explorers encounter bears, bald eagles, aging native american warriors, and a conquistador named hildago( kevin dunn) who raves about his beautiful hair. 
 the explorers' trek takes them through forests, across the snow- capped rocky mountains, and over a waterfall. 
 this setup leads to a lot of shouting, a great deal of lunacy, and very few laughs. 
 farley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing, but, aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle, his heart does n't seem to be in it.

"when i was nine, i started buying the coolest toy figures in my local department store. 
 masters of the universe was the pinnacle of what i was after for action figures: they combined science fiction and fantasy, had cool names like mekanek and stinkor and each came with its own little comic book to read. 
 of course, the animated series produced by filmation remains one of the most wildly successful television products in world history. 
 given the tremendous success of the toys and the cartoon( not to mention its moderately successful spin- off she- ra: princess of power), it was inevitable that a production company would put two and two together, come with the result of"" trillions"" and make a live- action masters movie.

 the story is painfully dull and mind- numbingly cliched

 i just do n't see how the life of a model is worthy of a two hour film.

"in 1970s, many european intellectuals, especially those on the left political hemisphere, became obsessed with the rise of fascism. 
 which was n't so hard to expect, because the social turmoil of 1960s and economic decline of 1970s seemed to be the breeding ground for many dangerous ideologies. 
 in such times, when political involvement could be associated with noble passion, many filmmakers tried to warn the present generations of dangers that lurk ahead by giving the look of pre- war europe and circumstances that led to phenomena like fascist italy and nazi germany. 
 of course, there were authors who jumped on the bandwagon for other, less noble reasons. 
 for them, moral depravity of fascism could be explained to the audience by explicitly showing sexual depravity of those era. 
 which, naturally, made some of those films very popular among teen audience. 
 one of such filmmakers was italian director tinto brass, who later made career shooting expensive, stylish soft porn. 
 salon kitty, his 1976 film, is very losely based on the novel by peter nordern, book that deals with bizarre yet true story that took place in the first years of ww2. 
 in 1939, walter schellenberg, one of the heads of nazi intelligence service has set up the elite, exclusive brothel in berlin with clientele comprised of top nazi officials and foreign diplomats. 
 none of the customers knew that the girls were all nazi agents, and that all the rooms happened to be bugged. 
 the most bizarre thing is the fact that not even kitty, nominal madame of the brothel, did n't know the real purpose of that enterprise. 
 screenplay by tinto brass, of course, simplifies the story and changes few names. 
 schellenberg is now wallenberg( helmut berger), ambitious nazi official who wants to use the brothel in order to blackmail his way to the top.

 director simon west treats issues like rape and sexual fetish with ham- handed obscenity, creating a film that banks almost entirely on exploitation and offensive pseudo- depth.

 michael myers has taken a character that would barely have supported a five- minute sketch on saturday night live and stretched it to the length of a feature film, padding it out with toilet jokes and the sort of props- strategically- positioned- between- naked- actors- and- camera gags that benny hill got tired of fifteen years ago. 
 the plot, what little there is of it: back in the swinging mod hep sixties( i do n't think i 'm doing a disservice to the movie 's attempted early look and feel by describing it that way), sexy british secret agent austin powers tangled with his nemesis dr. 
 evil. 
 evil launched himself into orbit and cryogenically forze himself to return decades later, when powers was out of the picture. 
 powers also had himself frozen, and he wakes up to find the nineties a very hard time to deal with. 
 the basic gag, that of powers' total inability to cope with the nineties, is not so much exhausted during the course of the movie as never even really dealt with. 
 the bulk of the movie is taken up with dumb jokes of several basic rubrics: james bond gags( of which this movie has no end, right down to the silly character names), inept slapstick, toilet humor, and strategically placed props...

"battlefield earth is the worst film of 2000, and i guarantee you that nothing else this year will even come close. 
 in fact, i 'll be surprised if i see anything this bad in the next ten years. 
 based on the novel by scientology guru l. ron hubbard, battlefield earth begins and we immediately find out two pieces of key information. 
 it 's the year 3000, and an alien race called the psychlos( which sounds like a tag team of mexican wrestlers) conquered our planet in nine minutes.

 when were we conquered? 
 the audience is led to believe that this happened about 1, 000 years earlier, and if that is the case then we 're going to get into a whole bunch of problems later( trust me... 
 keep reading). 
 also, why do n't we get to see earth get conquered? 
 how the hell do you make a popcorn sci- fi flick and not deliver the goods on the one event that sets up the film? 
 humans now live as cavemen or slave labor, and for the film 's first act we focus on one particular cavemen group outside of denver, colorado. 
 they grunt and groan and babble about monsters. 
 so, when the psychlos conquered earth, were the only humans not captured a herd of newborn babies that crawled their way to safety in the hills? 
 none of these characters have any knowledge of the planet being conquered( whenever that was). 
 this is definitely not the way to start an action/ sci- fi film. 
 one of the humans wanders out into the wilderness and stumbles across what he thinks is a monster, and he begins to fight it.

"vampires starts out almost in the style of a spaghetti western with an attack on a small homestead in new mexico. 
 the house has a nest of vampires and jack crow( james woods) is leading a team of vampire hunters in to clean them out. 
 while the initial imagery is a little over- dramatic, it gives way to what is a fairly decent action sequence. 
 that is enough action to last us a while 
 and we could, director john carpenter would let us, get to a story line. 
 but it is not very long and there is not much plot until the next big action scene. 
 then there is only a bit more of plot before the next action scene after that. 
 the plot is kept to a minimum and the interesting ideas in the plot really get the short end. 
 and that is something of a pity because the film, based on the book vampire$ by john steakley, gives us a myth for the origins of vampires and explains why vampires are so intertwined with religious imagery. 
 this could be an interesting departure from the standard vampire film, but carpenter decides to tell us about it rather than to show it. 
 what carpenter saves his serious screen time for a sequence of spectacular fights between hunters and vampires. 
 there is a lot of fighting and lots of gore. 
 anything intriguing is kept to a minimum to so it does not get in the way of pleasing the action film fans.

"when considering david fincher 's latest film,"" the game"", four words come to mind.

 this michael douglas vehicle, from the director of"" seven"", is n't nearly as clever or innovatively suspenseful

 the film draws us in with an intriguing concept( aided no doubt by the riveting trailer) where a jaded millionaire( douglas) is presented with the opportunity to enter into a living fantasy. 
 this is n't simply virtual reality.

 on his 48th birthday, nicholas van orton( douglas) is invited to dinner by his underachieving younger brother, conrad( sean penn).

"weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg 's reliance on formulas, 
_ saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches. 
 there ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics. 
 spielberg 's greatest strength as a director is the polished, formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story. 
 but for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war( or the holocaust) this technique backfires, for it creates coherent, comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size, complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken. 
 in this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films. 
_ saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a"" pr mission"" to pull a young man, ryan( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere) out of combat on the normandy front just after d- day. 
 ryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers. 
 the search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france. 
 there 's no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie. 
 the equipment, uniforms and weapons are superbly done. 
 the opening sequence, in which captain miller( tom hanks) leads his men onto omaha beach, is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat. 
 another pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg 's brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences, such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers, the banality of death in combat, the routine foul- ups in the execution of the war, and the cynicism of the troops. 
 the technical side of the film is peerless, as always.

"if you 're going to make a two- hour hollywood in- joke, why bother releasing it to the general public? if you 're going to create a film that will appeal primarily to big- name actors and people who know woody allen, then why waste the time of the rest of us peons by playing it in theaters? 
 while watching celebrity, i realized that allen had only marginal interest in creating a story about real people. 
 what he really wanted to do was continue on his recent kick of conceited self- deprecation. 
 celebrity is yet another film in which allen tells a story about himself, living in a world that he 's familiar with, dealing with people like the ones he actually knows. 
 allen recruited poor kenneth branagh to bumble through this picture, in an imitation of allen so perfect that it almost made me like the film more. 
 branagh plays lee simon, a journalist- turned- screenwriter who divorces his wife, robin( judy davis), shacks up with some hot women( famke janssen, charlize theron, winona ryder), and goes about trying to get big stars( melanie griffith, leonardo dicaprio) to read his script about an armored car robbery. 
 the usual elements of recent allen films are all here, including the sexual insecurity of the main character, lots of self- loathing women, and a tiring continuum of episodes that are only loosely related to one another. unless you work in the film industry or know woody allen personally, 
 it 's not likely that you 'll find a whole lot of interest in celebrity. aside from all the in- jokes, the story falls far short of compelling, and the characters are all empty and lifeless. 
 branagh proves once again that he 's a superb performer, nailing his imitation of allen flawlessly.

"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire. 
 usually, you had to be an aristocrat- a count such as dracula or karnstein. 
 to qualify, you 'd have to have a modicum of sophistication, so you 'd at least look cool- or suave- when biting into some young damsel 's throat. 
 but today, in our overly politically correct world, any scuzzy- looking, long- haired, unshaven lout or any spiked- haired harridans can put the bite on you. 
 by the same token, to be a vampire hunter, one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier, or at least one who retired with honors. 
 not in these times. 
 all you need are some sharp weapons, some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy- or a blade. 
 without sounding elitist, the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity. 
 which brings us to blade, the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which, it seems, half the population is putting the bite on the other half. 
 not only are there thousands of vampires, but they seem to move from city to city, pay off police departments and, most importantly, establish their own exclusive after- hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower. 
 with all that blood, you wonder why they have to hunt for victims. 
 you also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry- cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains. 
 blade, which is based on a marvel comic book character, is, like a comic book, all visual.

"it is with some sad irony that i screened fright night part 2 on the day that one of it 's stars, roddy mcdowall passed away at the age of 70. 
 mcdowall was one of the most talented and prolific actors in hollywood, having a career that spanned over 60 years and appearing in more than 100 films. 
 fright night part 2 probably will not be counted among his more memorable roles. 
 this is really sad considering how good the first fright night film was. 
 william ragsdale and roddy mcdowall both reprised their roles as the somewhat reluctant vampire killers who seem to be the only ones that realize that vampires walk among us.

 it has been several years since charlie brewster( ragsdale) and b- movie actor turned late night horror film host, peter vincent( mcdowall) came face to face with a real live vampire who just happened to be charlie 's next door neighbor. 
 charlie and peter won that battle, but apparently even vampires have relatives who get pissed if you kill members of their family. 
 apparently charlie 's former bloodsucking next door neighbor had a sister who was none too pleased to find out that some kid and an aging actor staked her sibling. 
 so she decides to exact a little bit of revenge. 
 this ends up forcing charlie and peter to battle the forces of darkness yet again. 
 one of the things that made fright night such a success was chris sarandon who played charlie 's stylish next door neighbor with a taste for blood.

 they have a beautiful house in suburbia. 
 jermaine is a lawyer on the fast track at his firm. 
 jasmine is his supportive wife, who is finishing up her college degree. 
 in an opening montage via a home video of the pair, we see the unremarkable story of their marriage and early marital triumphs. 
 this is a couple that has it all. 
 into this eden slithers the lure of lust. 
 despite his outward appearance, jermaine reveals himself as selfish and covetous of his wife more as a possession than a person. 
 a glimmer of his true nature peeks out during an early sex scene with his wife as he goes about his business, oblivious to jasmine 's concerns. 
 we also find that he has been relentlessly asking jasmine to participate in a menage- a- trois, much to jasmine 's dismay. 
 as jermaine puts it,"" do n't you want to be sexually free? 
"" 
 jermaine shares his desire with co- worker terrence( smith), who obligingly sets jermaine up with a woman who might be interested in just such an encounter. 
 the woman, jade( palmer) is a direct counterpoint to jasmine. 
 jade, at one point was a college student, too. 
 unlike jasmine, she found herself pregnant, dropped out of school and now struggles to make ends meet. 
 to further reinforce their differences, it 's revealed that jade is involved in a custody battle over her son. 
 inevitably, through liquor and a touch of duplicity on jermaine 's part, the forbidden act is consummated.

" mission to mars"" is one of those annoying movies where, in the middle of the movie, you get the sneaking suspicion that the reason the trailer looks so good is because they showcased all the best parts of the movie: all five minutes of it.

 they came up with, so they stretch each dramatic moment out like silly putty until 
 it loses all its charm

 glances do n't communicate any deeper emotions just because you draw them out for five hours on end.

 there are some spectacular special effects sequences in this film, and i give it points for trying to stay true to the science i know

 the sequence with the martian demonstrating their history is oddly beautiful and touching, but as mentioned by then 
 we 're so sick of the goddamn thing we want the movie to be over.

"this is the first film in what would become the most successful series of horror films of all time. 
 a fair warning to those of you who might be inclined to watch this movie for the first appearance of everyone 's favorite goalie- mask- wearing homicidal maniac. 
 jason, the guy who single handedly controlled the overpopulation problem around the crystal lake area, does n't start his quest to find the most interesting household item with which to kill someone until the sequel. 
 while he does have a small role in this film, we the audience have to depend on another blood thirsty maniac to rack up the body count. 
 the plot, like every other friday the 13th movie goes something like this -- crazed killer murders as many unsuspecting teenagers as he/ she/ it possibly can in the space of a 90 minute movie. 
 the reasons that the afore mentioned unsuspecting teenagers come into contact with the bloodthirsty killer are usually of little importance to the story. 
 but for those of you out there that might actually care about such trivial matters in a movie such as a plot, here are the basics. 
 a bunch of unsuspecting teens get a summer job at a long closed summer camp.

"there 's a good, and timely, story trapped deep within the excess of murder in the first, a new movie about the abuses of our prison system. 
 with a country wrapped up in feverish debate over the crime issue and the rights of the accused and the incarcerated in jeopardy, this expose would offer something rare to recent american movies -- a point of view.

 that pretentious, often nauseating, camera movements and slick, mtv- style lighting and editing are far more important. 
 there 's not a moment in the picture where he surrenders technique for pure storytelling.

 his young lawyer( slater) is fresh out of law school but determined to"" put alcatraz on trial"" for the abuses of it warden( gary oldman). 
 the result is the usual courtroom theatrics- imagine a stanley kramer production shot by hyperactive film school students.

 the avengers= silly= man dressed in a bowler hat+ woman wearing tight leathers

 the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast? 
 the same question was probably asked of last year 's stinker batman and robin. 
 i feel the production got a little too smug, 
 the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie. 
 my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed( thurman and fiennes)? 
 something that was a vital element of the 60 's tv serial of the same name. 
 the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks, but does not allow much room for character development and interaction, except to perhaps grate on the viewer 's nerves. 
 one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality. 
 connery as sir august, does not fair better than thurman or fiennes.

"you 've got mail works alot better than it deserves to. 
 in order to make the film a success, all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars, have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits. 
 no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in it 's body( it 's basically a complete re- shoot of the shop around the corner, only adding a few modern twists). 
 essentially, it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking. 
 it 's overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy, not to mention very manipulative. 
 but oh, how enjoyable that manipulation is. 
 but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does, because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/ hanks teaming, sleepless in seattle. 
 it could n't have been the directing, because both films were helmed by the same woman. 
 i have n't quite yet figured out what i liked so much about you 've got mail, but then again, is that really important? if you like something so much, why even question it? 
 again, the storyline is as cliched as they come. 
 tom hanks plays joe fox, the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and 
 meg ryan plays kathleen kelley, the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family- run children 's book shop called, in a nice homage, the shop around the corner. 
 fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business. 
 little do they know, they are already in love with each other over the internet, only neither party knows the other person 's true identity. 
 the rest of the story is n't important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen.

" jaws"" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen. 
 the movie opens with blackness, and only distant, alien- like underwater sounds. 
 then it comes, the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score. 
 dah- dum. 
 from there, director steven spielberg wastes no time, taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly. 
 right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean, and once"" jaws"" has attacked, it never relinquishes its grip. 
 perhaps what is most outstanding about"" jaws"" is how spielberg builds the movie. 
 he works it like a theatrical production, with a first act and a second act. 
 unlike so many modern filmmakers, he has a great deal of restraint, and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act. 
 until then, he merely suggests its presence with creepy, subjective underwater shots and williams' music. 
 he 's building the tension bit by bit, so when it comes time for the climax, the shark 's arrival is truly terrifying. 
 he does n't let us get bored with the imagery. 
 the first act opens with police chief martin brody( roy scheider), a new york cop who has taken an easy, peaceful job running the police station on amity island, a fictitious new england resort town where there has n't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years. 
 the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july, and the mayor, larry vaughn( murray hamilton), does n't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money. 
 brody is joined by matt hooper( richard dreyfuss), a young, ambitious shark expert from the marine institute. 
 hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark(",positive,"The review praises ""Jaws"" for its effective tension building, restraint in revealing the shark, and the director's skill in structuring the movie.

"moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post- salary cap era -- you 've got to know how to allocate your resources. 
 every dollar spent on a free- agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers. 
 in the nfl, this leads to teams like the detroit lions, who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract, but can only field five guys named herb to block for him. 
 in the movies, you end up with films like"" spawn"", with a huge special- effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors. 
 jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking. 
 he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line. 
 watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid, fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars, is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit, except that sanders does n't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages. 
 but like the lions star, jackie does n't have anybody to block for him. 
 almost every cent that 's invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts, and as chan does his own stunts, the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills. 
 this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors( chan directs), scripts and dubbing and supporting characters, not to mention the hideous title sequence. 
 this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain.

"apparently, director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film, american history x. 
 i do n't know the details of the fight, but it seems that he is not happy with the final product, and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether. 
 i 've heard about this kind of thing happening before, and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce. 
 as it is, i found american history x to be an extremely good film, not just because of tony kaye 's focused look at the touchy subject of racism, but because of a powerful, charismatic performance from edward norton. 
 it 's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton 's fantastic role in primal fear, but, here he is now, starring in his own film and making himself a star. 
 norton is one of those performers who becomes his character, and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year. 
 he plays a young man named derek vinyard, a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother, danny( edward furlong), mother( beverly d'angelo), and sister, davin( jennifer lien). 
 the film opens with a flashback, in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car. 
 we find out that this lands him in prison, and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny. 
 in the present- time of the film, danny is in high school, and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother.

"one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy 's wedding. 
 and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it. 
 her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald, who has n't made a worthwhile film since 1986. 
 but the fact is, betsy 's wedding is also an alan alda film. 
 and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years, alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects, including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life. 
 written and directed by alda, betsy 's wedding is a vibrant slice- of- life, mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor. 
 alda 's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing 
 --and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare. 
 as bride and groom, molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film, but they are by far the least interesting. 
 walsh is a nonentity, with all the screen presence of a door knob. 
 ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain. 
 she looks hideous with her short- cropped orange hair, red lip- stick and grotesque outfits. 
 she 's supposed to be a dress designer, but she looks more like a clown. 
 and to make matters worse, ringwald 's performance matches her appearance. 
 thankfully, alda keeps ringwald 's screen time to a minimum; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters. 
 the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride 's working- class, italian family and the groom 's rich, gentile family. 
 ringwald 's folks are homey and down- to- earth, with alda as her free- spirited father, madeline kahn as her practical mother, and ally sheedy as her lonely sister.

 with unrest building, moise tshombe( pascal nzonzi) and the province of katanga, which contained 70 percent of the country 's resources, proclaimed secession. 
 lumumba replaced janssens, making mobutu a colonel, and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu( maka kotto), but it was too late.' when you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies,' prophesies lumumba of his own fate. 
 peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly regarding lumumba 's private life.

"the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire- fu copycats. 
 it 's not a pretty death, and it 's leaving the likes of schwartznager, stallone, and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea. 
 sometimes, the mix results in a mind- blowing spectacle unlike any other. 
 quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work, as in 1999 's the matrix, can be a real gem.

 flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists. 
 mostly it 's laughable.

 iron monkey( actually a reissue of a 1993 film) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante( rongguang yu), fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry. 
 but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero 
 wong fei- hong, most recently seen in one of the most overlooked, and possibly best films of 2000, drunken master 2( released in the u. s. as the legend of drunken master).

 nicolas cage is seth, a guardian angel who, like hundreds( likely thousands or even millions) of other angels, spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life.

 cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders, but since the americans do n't speak cinque 's language, the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves. 
 technically, since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time, people like cinque could n't be kidnapped into slavery; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave. 
 lawyers baldwin and adams( matthew 
 mcconaughey and anthony hopkins) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery, rather than born slaves, in order to get them out of prison as free men. 
 three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg 's trademark panache-- flashy beginning, lots of facial close- ups, big music, and dramatic imagery. 
 a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters. 
 opinion: making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life. 
 in fiction, one invents purposeful, clear- cut good guys and bad guys, puts the fictional characters in conflict, and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion. 
 real life, however, consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around, think thoughts and do nothing, or come and go before events are resolved.

 lives are often at stake, and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable, prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment 's notice. 
 the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor, psychologist, and sham artist, in addition to being a police officer; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence, or failing that, must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower. 
 most of all, the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible, and quickly gain control of the situation, dominate the conversation, and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants. 
 it takes a pretty smart person to do that.

"the ultimate match up between good and evil,"" the untouchables"" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry. 
 based on the 1959 television show of the same title,"" the untouchables"" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place, but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences, some excellent acting, a memorable score, and a clever script. 
 the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public. 
 elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order. 
 however, as ness soon learns, in order to stabilize peace, you have to bend a few laws. 
 the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes. 
 the film begins with capone, played perfectly by deniro, declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws. 
 the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone 's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl. 
 from this point we know capone is evil, not only because he kills without hesitation, but also because he is a lying bastard. 
 right from the first five minutes of the film, de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs. 
 this developed hatred is before the film 's hero, ness, is even introduced. 
 i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone. 
 the film only gets better from this point. 
 with the formation of the untouchables, there is a group of men wearing long, dark overcoats and hats. 
 they walk in unison and they only look forward. 
 as they walk down the streets",positive,"The review appreciates ""The Untouchables"" for its deeper look into an already examined rivalry.

"having not seen,"" who framed roger rabbit"" in over 10 years, and not remembering much besides that i liked it then, i decided to rent it recently. 
 watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is. aside from the fact that it 's a milestone in animation in movies( it 's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters, 
 have them interact, and make it convincingly real) and a great entertainment 
 it 's also quite an effective comedy/ mystery. 
 while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original, especially baby herman, and watching them together is a lot of fun. 
 the story begins in hollywood in 1947. 
 cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work, so hard- boiled private detective eddie valiant( bob hoskins) is called in by studio head r. 
 k. 
 maroon( alan tilvern) to try to help get roger 's mind back on work. 
 maroon thinks that roger 's wife, jessica 's, possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots. 
 valiant takes some photos of jessica playing,` patty cake' with marvin acme( stubby kaye), the owner of toontown( where all of the cartoon characters live) and takes them to maroon. upon seeing them, roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect. 
 the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town( and eventually toontown) trying to clear roger 's good name. 
 along the way they meet judge doom( christopher lloyd) 
 a judge- jury- and executioner type who 's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a` toon.'

"one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction. 
 the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy, innocent fun. 
 sometimes the stories are compelling. 
 sometimes they 're not. 
 but, with the exception of the first film in the series( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces), i 've never been bored by any of the enterprise 's numerous missions.

 others say the special effects are cheesy and that it 's boring. 
 i simply enjoyed the film. 
 insurrection, which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast, introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku; the ba'ku are very old( most of them are about three hundred years old), but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet.

 from ace ventura to truman burbank, jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic, yet sympathetic, characters. 
 1996 's the cable guy was supposed to be his big"" breakthrough"" role from zany humor into darker, more dramatic acting. 
 as most everyone knows, the results were, well, less- than- stellar. 
 not only did the film not do so hot at the box office, but it was also panned by critics. as far as i know, gene siskel 
 and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it. 
 the first time i saw the cable guy, in theatres, i was in super critic- mode, and did n't really like it. 
 however, due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day, i 've had time to lean back, relax, and take in the film. 
 and to my surprise, it grew on me. 
 the plot is rather simple: broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy, played by carrey, then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship. 
 see, steven 's been having some problems with his girlfriend, robin( leslie mann), and he does n't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend. 
 also, some of the cable guy 's antics have been creeping him out. 
 carrey, as the cable guy, gives steven various aliases, which later we find out are all tv characters: 
 larry tate, chip douglas, ricky ricardo, etc. 
 he apparently lives in his cable van, and while many critics did n't enjoy this newer, darker, less- manic performance from carrey, 
 i thought it was interesting and rather well- done 
. 
 for me, its not the movie as a whole that 's enjoyable, but rather several individual scenes: 
 a karaoke jam at steven 's apartment, a medieval fight at a theme restaurant",positive,"The review appreciates ""The Cable Guy"" for its simple plot and Jim Carrey's performance.

"when bulworth ended, i allowed myself a sigh of relief:? 
 it is possible for me to enjoy political satire.? 
 there have been several recent political films that did n't do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog, for instance, i found to be an intelligent but heartless film, while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness.? 
 bulworth is a far better film than these, both in its execution and lasting impression. 
? 
 it 's a tremendously funny and intelligent picture, but it also has an emotional center -- writer/ director/ star warren beatty

 he has n't slept in days, nor has he eaten, and, almost instantaneously, he goes insane.? 
 he 's not stark raving mad( not outright, anyway), but he 's definitely bonkers.

"call 911 for the cliche police if you must, but the eyes are the window to the soul. 
 the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze: paul newman, ralph fiennes, anthony hopkins, morgan freeman. 
 you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds, that the characters they play are real human beings. 
 we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor, but he had that unique quality in his eyes. 
 in gridlock'd, an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire, shakur and his co- star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry.

 they soon make a new year 's resolution to get into rehab, but that proves to be easier said than done. 
 as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough, spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy, confusion and red tape. 
 the government might be the least of their obstacles, however, as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer, and on the run from a nasty thug( vondie curtis hall). 
 in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all, you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie, they are going to government offices on new year 's day, in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all.

"the most common( and in many cases the only) complaint against francis ford coppola 's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia, which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour, loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler, kinder ages.

 this film was goodfellas, epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s. 
 goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story, told in best- seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi( who would co- write the screenplay for the film).

 one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own, everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise.

 the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars. 
 to see these bars blocking his face, we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film. 
 as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots, no matter how innocent tibbs is, he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin. 
 the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is, instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous. 
 this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds. 
 it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film. 
"" in the heat of the night"" was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america. 
 jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental.

"in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer\ professor with such lived- in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance. 
 ever since wall street, douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80 's. 
 in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen, with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world. 
 you 'd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good- natured veneer, but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton, douglas played the role straight and out in the open. 
 in wonder boys his performance is n't showy or a tour de force, it 's simple yet truthful. 
 he embodies grady, a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes. 
 grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map. 
 when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop, we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms. 
 grady points out, in his narration, that they only do so out of jealousy. 
 their target is the very writerly named james leer( played by the always understated tobey maguire), a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for. 
 leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions. 
 he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges. 
 he 's portentous and gloomy, as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers, though his act is a little too calculated. 
 he reminds me of the self- imposed outcast film director, jim jarmusch( dead man, ghost dog).

 quick and easy review: i really enjoyed matinee. 
 the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely. 
 unlike many comedies this film tries, and succeeds, in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh. 
 the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story. 
 the performances of all the principals are right on the mark, particularly john goodman as the schlock master. 
 so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted, yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours. 
 longer, more detailed review:[ beware of spoilers] the primary reason 
 i enjoyed this film was, that while being a comedy, the film also had an intelligent story to tell. 
 too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh. 
 you watch the movie, laugh a lot, leave the theatre and take nothing with you. 
 matinee is not like that. 
 i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis. 
 i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film. 
 but most importantly, i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters. 
 the comedy of the film centers around goodman, his character, and the film he brings to key west. 
 i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today. 
 he is highly expressive both physically and vocally. 
 i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for",positive,"The review praises the movie ""Matinee"" for its blend of comedy and tension. The reviewer appreciates the performances of the actors, especially John Goodman, and the intelligent story of the movie.

"when_ star wars_ came out some twenty years ago, the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image. 
 when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars, we see constellations, meteor showers, and cool space- ships. 
 when han solo goes light speed, the stars change to bright lines, going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point. 
 cool. 
_ october sky_ offers a much simpler image -- that of a single white dot, traveling horizontally across the night sky. 
 was it really only forty years ago, when sputnik was launched, and that before then, no satellites ever existed? 
 have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then- technological achievement, even though it was from the russians? 
 it sounds hokey, but when that scene occurs near the beginning of_ october sky_, i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam, played by jake gyllenhaal. 
 determined to make a dent in the space race, he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them.

 when lovely teacher miss riley( played by laura dern), suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair, we know exactly who is going to win.

 it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school, who knows more about rocket science than he does.

"every year, hollywood crowns a new"" it boy"" --a 
 young actor pegged for major movie stardom. 
 inheriting the mantle from last year 's"" winner,"" matthew mcconaughey, is matt damon, and, like mcconaughey, he proves to be more than just a fresh young face, as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release -- john grisham 's the rainmaker and good will hunting. 
 damon has his first major starring role, a la mcconaughey, in a john grisham adaptation -- in this case, francis ford coppola 's take on the rainmaker. 
 damon plays wet- behind- the- ears attorney rudy baylor, who, immediately after passing the bar exam, finds himself representing the mother( mary kay place) of a terminally ill young man( john whitworth) in a big- league suit against a negligent insurance company. 
 while rudy 's( and the film 's) main concern is this case, he also finds time to protect a young wife( claire danes) from her abusive husband( melrose placer andrew shue, in a mercifully brief role). 
 written for the screen and directed by coppola, the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet 
 mostly because it does not take itself too seriously. 
 coppola 's most notable -- and effective -- contribution to the tried- and- true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself, which largely comes in the presence of danny devito( as rudy 's unlicensed co- counsel) and golden globe nominee jon voight( as the insurance company 's hotshot attorney). 
 the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous, but danes is as superb as always. 
 then, of course, there is damon, who nicely juggles the weighty( the insurance case, the spousal abuse) and the humorous( rudy 's often comical naivete) requirements of his role without missing a beat. as good as he is in the rainmaker, damon showcases the depth of his talent in good

"synopsis: leonard shelby( pearce) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife. 
 leonard has only a few clues to the murderer 's identity; to make matters worse, he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short- term memories, meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier. 
 because of this, leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself. 
"" memento"" traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination. 
 review: 
"" memento"" is the sort of movie i wish i 'd written; i can think of no higher praise than that. 
 i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant, involved, original movie as this. 
 an instant film noir classic,"" memento"" is virtually flawless. 
 the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity. 
 although the idea of starting at the"" conclusion"" of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the"" start"" is not entirely new, never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence. 
"" memento"" is endlessly exciting and inventive, a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself, and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre. 
 and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively. 
 nolan 's direction is equally effective, never losing its crispness and clarity despite"" memento"" 's challenging gimmick. 
 and to top everything off 
, all the performances rise to the occasion. 
 pierce is terrific 
 as the troubled leonard; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie; and pantoliano 's teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality. 
"" memento"" may be the year 's best screenplay, and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001.

"earth is a harsh, unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent. 
 people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict, as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets: indian and pakistani; muslim, hindu, sikh, parsee. 
 the story takes place in lahore, which was indian before partition, and pakistani afterward, regardless of what its citizens might call themselves. 
 the action is seen through the eyes of lenny( maaia sethna), a young parsee girl, but it is really about her nanny, shanta. 
 shanta has a small circle of male admirers. 
 two of the men are suitors: hasan( rahul khanna), a hindu, and dil navaz( aamir khan), a muslim. 
 the others -- sikh, hindu, muslim -- are older; some are married; but all appreciate shanta, who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das. 
( she also starred in deepa mehta 's previous film, fire, the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water.) in an early scene, the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears. 
 one of the men remarks, jokingly, that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along.

"i was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory. 
 this was, of course, a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me 
 and i never get a chance at something like this. 
 not only did i get to see an advance screening, i was able to see an advance screening of a* very good* movie. 
 the very fast- paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher, a fast- talking, witty, comical taxi driver in new york city. 
 gibson 's performance is terrific, and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films. 
 gibson again teams up with richard donner, as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick, and this time around, the combination works even better. 
 the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique. try to imagine a toned- downed version of travis bickle who, this time around, is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover- ups. if you can imagine that, then you 've basically got jerry fletcher.

 but then he runs into belone( michel aumont), an elderly homosexual neighbor, who suggests a"" sex discrimination"" lawsuit to intimidate management. 
 as evidence, belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather- clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon 's boss. 
 when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory, not only does pignon get his job back 
 but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man. 
 his lusty supervisor( michele laroque) is so intrigued that she wonders if, perhaps, she could change his sexual preferences. 
 even his ex- wife( alexandra vandernoot) and indifferent teenage son( stanislas crevillen) drop their disdain.

 a mucho macho co- worker felix( gerard depardieu), a self- righteous homophobe, is stunned and repulsed when he 's forced by the pr director( thierry lhermite) to grovel and court pignon 's friendship or risk losing his own job. 
 writer/ director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness, veering off- track only occasionally into pedophilia.

 however the emperor 's evil son commodus( joaquin phoenix) murders his father before the announcement can be made, and maximus( as well as his family) is sentenced to be executed. 
 maximus is able to escape his executioners, but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo( oliver reed).

"you 've seen this moment before, recently: a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing. 
 the difference is that when it happens to lili taylor 's nell in the haunting, we do n't care. 
 the hero of the sixth sense, a young boy named cole, is a rich creation, and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike. 
 the seasons have changed since an ex- patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe( willis) in the comfort of his own bedroom. 
 desperate to get his career back on track, even at the expense of his crumbling marriage( to williams, of rushmore) 
, malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole( osment). 
 the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolm 's would- be killer: 
 scars on his body; antisocial behaviour; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret. 
 only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies( and hospitalized as a result) does he divulge to malcolm, in a spine- tingling scene, that he sees dead people walking among us, all the time. 
 malcolm assumes, and given his profession, reasonably so, that cole is schizophrenic, not psychic, but the sincerity in cole 's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures. 
 he will instead pursue the supernatural angle, becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole( who lives with his single mother, lynn( collette)) in the process. 
 the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist. 
( though shyamalan does, somewhat unforgiveably, crib the self- rearranging kitchen business from the latter.) 
 it 's far more heartwarming than frightening, and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks.

"hollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death( no pun intended- honest). 
 it 's a shame, too, because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b- movie monsters. 
 i mean, come on. 
 are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour? 
 hell no. 
 and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell, but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well, not commonly associated with horror films.

 let me backtrack a minute. 
 when i say"" intellectual ground"", i do n't mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that, i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to, a little bit of thinking is involved. 
 with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what- not, you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown.

"stendhal 's syndrome: a condition where, in the presence of art, a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression, suicidal behaviour and personality disorder. 
 grim stuff, to be sure, but the subject of a remarkable film from italy 's master of the horror thriller dario argento. boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone 
, the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento. 
 it follows his disappointing american debut trauma( 1992), the patchy opera( 1987) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 's. 
 based on the novel by graziella magherini, the film stars argento 's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist- killer. 
 visiting florence to follow up several leads, she is lured by the killer alfredo( thomas kretschmann) to an art gallery, a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail. 
 at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints. 
 posing as a bystander, alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer, a strange game of cat and mouse begins. 
 a gripping story evolves, and a coherent one, too, which may surprise those familiar with argento 's often lumpy narratives. 
 the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop- hunting- killer scenario. 
 it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central character 's psychological disintegration. 
 the script explores its psycho- sexual themes with intelligence and candour, perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers. 
 but as dark as its themes are, the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years.

"zero effect gets its title from the main character, daryl zero( bill pullman), although we do n't understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film. 
 zero is a private investigator, perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived( at least he 'd like to think so). 
 however, he 's a socially inept being, and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are. 
 zero 's accomplice is steve arlo( ben stiller), a"" normal"" guy who does the business side of the job -- he 's the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zero 's greatness as an investigator. 
 the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zero 's talents to soon- to- be client gregory stark( ryan o'neal). 
 it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box, and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about. 
 zero takes the case, and the plot thickens. 
 his path leads to a young, pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan( kim dickens). 
 despite her luminous and seemingly- harmless presence, she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark. 
 through his investigations, zero learns why, but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that, because of his reclusive behavior, are new and confusing to him.

"the long kiss goodnight( r) meryl streep tried it and failed. 
 even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well- bared assets. 
 however, geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star 
 with the long kiss goodnight, 
 a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband, renny harlin. 
 davis plays samantha caine, a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years. 
 with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey( samuel l. jackson), she slowly remembers -- and reclaims -- her past as charly baltimore, tough- as- nails cia operative. 
 needless to say, with the reappearance of samantha/ charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no- goodniks out to erase more than her memory. 
 shane black netted a cool$ 4 mil for his script; i 'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag, but for what it 's worth, 
 it delivers the goods. 
 like black 's previous work, such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout,

 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation. 
 townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them. 
 cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery. 
 comments: tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years. 
 batman, of course, is perhaps his best- known film and led to a string of less successful sequels. 
 he 's done biographical work( on the director ed wood), children 's movies( nightmare before christmas), and a homage to alien invasion movies( mars attacks!). 
 sleepy hollow, his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while, shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies. 
 sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s, especially hammer studios' reworkings of dracula and frankenstein, and american international 's series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe. 
 christopher lee, in fact, star of many hammer productions over the years, appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders. 
 the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s. 
 one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein. 
 i mention these allusions for a reason.

 it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well. 
 although, at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie. 
 the ideas behind blade are good, as is the basic plot of the story. 
 but at times, things seem to get a bit muddled, and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once. 
 that really does n't take away from the story too much, but it does hurt it a little bit. 
 blade( snipes) is half man, half vampire. 
 his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire. 
 including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust. 
 blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother.

, burbank 's life is being broadcast live to the american public, and seahaven and all it 's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage. 
 the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far... 
 with an idea so different, it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator. 
 luckily, the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages, yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie. 
 talking of carrey, 
 he 's perfect in this movie, enjoying the best role in his career. 
 his character is a re- inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask( 1994) and is completely suited to carrey 's persona. 
 he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode, shrieking and being silly, but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey. 
 he 's not completely dramatic like the film promises, however. 
 ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff, the megalomaniac creator of the show. 
 quiet and well spoken, he burns an image into the viewer. 
 unfortunately, he 's barely in the film, and for the first hour dosen't appear at all! 
 also disappointing is natascha mcelhone 's character sylvia. 
 she plays the role well, but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her.

"no film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordan 's harrowing, humorous, horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabe 's novel about young lad francie brady 's( eamonn owens) descent into madness in 1960s ireland. 
 on one hand, it was difficult for me to become invested in francie 's story because he is such an unsavory character, unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs. 
 nugent( fiona shaw). 
 on another hand, i found it difficult to laugh at some of francie 's darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick, needy child, having been raised by a drunken father( stephen rea) and a suicidal mother( aisling o'sullivan). 
 on yet another hand, i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his, for lack of a better word,"" bad"" deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them. 
 however, the butcher boy 's power is undeniable, and the film as a whole is unforgettable -- perhaps because it is so disturbing. 
 what makes it so unsettling is the francie 's overall wink- wink yet matter- of- fact attitude about everything, expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie( rea again). 
 think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs, and you 'll sort of understand. 
 anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens; love francie or hate him, you can not take your eyes off of owens. 
 the butcher boy truly is a twisted, unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable. 
 in the lobby after the screening, i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust,"" that movie was so unfunny!""

"just how inseparable is the team of sgt. 
 martin riggs( mel gibson) and sgt. 
 roger murtaugh( danny glover)? 
 let 's just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road, flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction, his partner actually does it! 
 the familiar lethal weapon family is back, including rene russo, who is now the expectant mother of riggs' child and joe pesci as the soprana- like, foul- mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye. 
 new to the team is chris rock, also a fast- talking, up and coming detective. 
 trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go, and in this film, that is no exception. 
 even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride, they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship.

 gunfire ensues, and when it 's all over, the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord.

"since 1990, the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style. 
 now, instead of emphasizing feel- good stories replete with characters of noble virtues, the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow. 
 this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times, as 1993 's schindler 's list shows. 
 most of today 's mainstream drama, however, creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience. 
 that 's why pictures like october sky, which are a throwback to the good ol' dramas of yesteryear, are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema. 
 the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam( jake gyllenhaal), a teenager in the 1950 's company town of coalwood, west virginia. 
 it 's a well- known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine. 
 the mine, which is run by homer 's father( chris cooper), is not the place for homer, however. 
 after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957, homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it,"" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did. 
"" drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast, homer begins to construct rockets. 
 with the help of their history teacher, miss riley( laura dern), and several mine workers, the four are soon bound for great things. 
 october sky is a skillfully crafted film, and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston. 
 johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well- known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he 's doing here.

"a big surprise to me. 
 the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off, but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues( john belushi) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope. 
 they replaced him just fine. 
 not with john goodman, he did n't do much of anything, but with the brilliant actor joe morton, who can really sing. 
 the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant, who 's ten. 
 this was another of my fears for the film, but he 's a really good dancer, and plays a mean harmonica 
( although he may have been dubbed). 
 things that intellectually had bothered me before, like no mission from god, everyone being richer, it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all. 
 i 'm quite pleased that there were less car pile- ups, because they meant less music, and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing. 
 there 's a few early crashes, and then one huge pile- up, but after that it all stops. 
 it 's just the music. 
 one of my problems with the first is that cab calloway 's song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him, but there 's no problems with this. 
 the music is all as good as ever, tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang, who ca n't sing, 
 all the musicians do a great job. 
 the only real problems i had was the special effects. 
 these were superfluous and a waste of money.

"after having heard so many critics describe"" return to me"" as an old- fashioned hollywood romance, i kept asking myself going into this movie: what exactly is an old- fashioned hollywood romance? 
 what made"" return to me"" old- fashioned and old- hollywood? was it the tunes from sinatra, etc., legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on? 
 was it the glamorous, sophisticated feel 
? the charisma of the two leads? 
 even now i ca n't say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer, because i have n't see that many old- fashioned hollywood romances. 
 i do n't think any of the romances i 've seen have been classified as such. which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics --"" return to me"" was old- fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic, the way 
 i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider. 
 it was traditional, magical. 
 we knew it could n't be too daring, or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in. 
 it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity, tenderness, and love( from director bonnie hunt) that it could n't help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings. 
 the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt 's direction. 
 from the very first bird 's eye view of chicago, zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland( david duchovny), accompanied by the"" return to me"" ballad( by whom?), we can tell we 're in for something sweet.

 the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item, an egg.

"many people dislike french films for their lack of closure. while possibly shallow, i 've often had a desire for a sense of epiphany, or at least a resolution, in the films which i view. 
 there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional; however, the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion- denying protagonist, stephane( daniel auteuil). 
 stephane( daniel auteuil) is a master violin maker. 
 he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing. 
 even the relationship between he and his boss, maxime( andre dussollier) is a controlled, and almost manipulated association, highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches. 
 in the beginning of the movie, stephane is a closed, solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man. 
 camille kessler( emmanuelle beart) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes. 
 maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife. 
 like stephane, camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved, sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges. 
 when stephane and camille meet, there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals. 
 however, whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane, stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him.

"accepting his oscar as producer of this year 's best picture winner, saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over. 
 one could almost say the same about his much- prized film. 
 rarely is the screen 
 so overflowing with potent imagery, symbolism, ideas and metaphors, complex and literate storytelling, 
 all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny, an acuity of perception and observation 
 that must somehow yield the truth. 
 in short, the antithesis of all things hollywood. 
 yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind. 
 ralph fiennes is the title character, an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory, and particularly the memory of love, is the ostensible focus of the film. 
 but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together, we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him. 
 his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld. 
 the same can easily be said for every other character in the film, of which there are too many. 
 juliette binoche 's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart. 
 at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her, and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious, disfigured, dying stranger. 
 even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion, however, that it verges on the comical. 
 with so many characters enjoying so little screen time, the film 's 160 minutes can be taxing. yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i could n't help but

" footloose"" has only one goal in mind: to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel- good antics. 
 and i hate to admit it; i fell for it. 
 the movie is about a teenager( bacon) who moves to a small town from the big city, and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend( lithgow). 
 he ends up falling for the preacher 's daughter( singer) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do. 
 as mentioned at the beginning of this review,"" footloose"" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama.

 we 're rooting for him right from the start, and, unlike most films of this genre, bacon does n't play him as the"" rebel without a clue"" sort. 
 yes, he does rebel, but he 's also polite when he needs to be. 
 and he never broods. 
 the rest of the cast is equally impressive. 
 john lithgow, seen here playing a normal guy for a change, is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian.

"as i walked out of crouching tiger, hidden dragon 
 i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film 
. 
 with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a"" great"" piece of work and viceversa. 
 attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs. 
 i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology. 
 as the word implies, a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master. 
 as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality. 
 crouching tiger, hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category. 
 crouching tiger, hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore, with the requisite blend of legend, fantasy, magic and mythology. 
 it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half- gods- greater than life, purer than life, stronger than life, physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats, but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable. 
 all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix, including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement. 
 the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop, with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil, which must choose between the two. 
 it is the gifted pupil who, under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend. 
 the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters) are poignantly represented. 
 the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively. 
 the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours- de- force, not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art, as are the prodigious leaps and flights",positive,"The review praises the movie for its exceptional quality and its immersion of the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore. The reviewer seems to appreciate the blend of legend, fantasy, magic, and mythology in the movie.",0.14904018844218236

"meet joe black( reviewed on nov. 
 27/98) 
 starring brad pitt, anthony hopkins, claire forlani in"" meet joe black"", brad pitt plays death. 
 that 's all that really needs to be said, but nevertheless, i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description. 
 death decides to take a holiday, what with all the rigors of soul- collecting and all, and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it 's like to be human. 
 death assumes the body of brad pitt, and from there, much trouble ensues. 
 for one thing, death- as- pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter, played by claire forlani. 
 obviously this enrages hopkins, because really, what can death offer? 
 besides eternal damnation, of course. 
 there is also a sub- plot about forlani 's ex- boyfriend( she dumps him for pitt) trying to take over hopkins company. 
"" meet joe black"" runs just under three hours. 
 i 've always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics. 
"" meet joe black"" is neither historical nor is it an epic, though i get the feeling martin brest( the director) 
 desperately wants it to be. 
 every single scene in the movie goes on about 3- 4 minutes too long. 
 and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should. 
 a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent, instead of just good, which is what it is. 
 pitt, an actor i normally loathe, is actually quite engaging as death. 
 i believed his performance, and i could see why forlani 's character would fall in love with him. 
 i have to agree with roger ebert, though, who found it hard to believe that an entity that 's been around for all time would n't know what peanut butter was. 
 that has nothing to do with pitt 's performance, of course, but it is a little distracting.",positive,The review appreciates the movie for its good execution despite its long duration.

 gregory hoblit 's fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual, horrific twist. 
 if marketed properly, this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim, dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven. 
 in fact, there 's even a little twin peaks to be found here, albeit with 
 the lion 's share of the weirdness distilled out. 
( remember bob?) 
 the biggest failing of fallen is that, although it 's consistently interesting 
, it 's not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope. 
 a serial killer( elias koteas) has been on the loose in philadephia, but detective john hobbes( denzel washington), the noblest man on the police force, has brought him to justice.

"james l. brooks, one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news, returns to the big screen with this entertaining, if slightly flawed comedy. 
 nicholson plays melvin udall, probably the most horrible person ever on the screen. 
 he 's racist, homophobic, and never has a good word to say to anyone. 
 so, nobody talks to him, except waitress carol conelly( t. 
 v sitcom star hunt, who was last seen in twister, 1996). 
 naturally, udall, conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop( kinnear) who nicholson hates, all hit it off in the end. 
 like good will hunting( 1997) and titanic( 1997), even though the outcome is completely obvious, as good as it gets is an enjoyable, funny and warm comedy. 
 nicholson is hilarious as melvin, churning out insults with superb relish. 
 only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers. 
 hunt is also good as waitress carol, and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson. 
 there 's also( thankfully) a bit of chemistry between them. 
 kinnear, as the gay neighbor, seems to have a slightly underwritten role, he 's more of a plot convience than a character. 
 although his performance is good, his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together. 
 in fact, the scene stealer is simon 's dog, who is funnier than nicholson.

"after a stylistic detour with mrs. 
 parker and the vicious circle( which, despite its uncomfortable tone, was close to being a conventional movie) 
, director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow, a romantic black comedy about love, betrayal, and self- absorption. 
 while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture, rudolph 's atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing, if not always pleasant, movie. 
 it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director? 
 meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it. 
 until mrs. 
 parker, i had not been overly impressed by his movies. 
 i found equinox, his last pre- mrs. 
 parker effort, to be irritating and frustrating. 
 i was somewhat surprised, therefore, to discover that i liked afterglow. 
 there are several reasons for this, but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident, mannered aspects of his approach. 
 the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems, 
 the story is absorbing, and the acting is top- notch. in short, rudolph has created a world that it 's worth spending two hours in. 
 afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples. 
 jeffrey byron( jonny lee miller) is a cold, seemingly- heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife, marianne( lara flynn boyle). 
 for her part, marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level. 
 all she 's interested in is seducing him during those few days when she 's ovulating. 
 after he refuses to make love, she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor.

" 
 the fugitive"" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made. 
 it takes realistic, believable characters and tells an exciting story 
 that 's totally believable throughout. 
 this is n't an over- the- top action flick for the sake of action, this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and 
 it works perfectly. 
 harrison ford stars as dr. 
 richard kimble, a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife. 
 the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder, but is not told in a straightforward manner. 
 we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble 's perspective. 
 hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble 's wife, helen( sela ward) was murdered. 
 we do n't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story. 
 in fact, we might even have a little doubt about kimble 's innocence ourselves. 
 the film does n't spend much time on the details of kimble 's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story. 
 one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck. 
 but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated 
, it is actually suspenseful to watch. 
 this movie is so incredible because it 's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable. 
 tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard, a u. s. 
 marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives. 
 from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur. 
 kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other.

 ford does not have a lot of lines here, so it is stuart and twohy 's script",positive,The review appreciates the movie for its believable and exciting story.

 i have n't laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers. 
 sandler plays robby hart, a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music. 
 in the opening scenes, he seems like a happy- go- lucky wedding singer, at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual( steve buscemi) who decides that his brother 's wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life, up to that point, was utter pointlessness.

"on re- watching italian writer/ director dario argento 's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae, i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with. 
 in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles, but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his"" giallo"" murder mysteries. 
 while it 's certainly not perfect, repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller. 
 the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal( anthony franciosa) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book"" tenebrae"". 
 with the police on his back for leads, he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems. 
 the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa. 
 he brings grace, charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real- life horror around him. 
 the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension. 
 argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral, ambivalent, shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business. 
 tenebrae is perhaps the most multi- layered of argento 's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here. 
 it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play. 
 in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/ profondo rosso( the full- length italian language version) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes.

"is evil dead ii a bad movie? 
 it 's full of terrible acting, pointless violence, and plot holes

 explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots( including the original evil dead) is extremely difficult.

` five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly, hairy, wart covered monsters.'

` it 's funny to see people die? 
 are you sick or something?' 
 maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie. 
 his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle, as disturbing as it is hilarious. 
 an example of raimi 's odd approach: a monster( formerly protagonist ash 's girlfriend of all people) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound. 
 sure it 's over- the- top, but it is so over- the- top that it is laugh out loud funny; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood, staining his face and knocking him back a few feet. 
 the whole movie is like this, watch ash get beat up, watch ash defeat the monster, watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster. 
 the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets, the more amusing it becomes. 
 no matter how sick it may sound, it is funny to watch

 when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost, the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way. 
 the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them. 
 the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey. 
 when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food. 
 when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission, they never dream he will be successful, they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food.

"not since oliver stone 's natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary, and not since david cronenberg has a so- called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility. 
 while fincher 's films have never suffered from a lack of shock value( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples), fight club marks the distillation of his pitch- black comedic sensibility( see 1997 's the game) into something like a definitive statement.

 in fact, even though the cast is filled with many name actors( b- actors as they might be for the most part), most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim.

" from the commercials, this looks like a mild- mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight. 
 instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end. 
 the concept is deceptively pedestrian. 
 an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way. 
 the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea. 
 the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents. 
 following one dead end lead after another, each funnier than the previous, they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents: alan alda and lily tomlin. 
 it 's difficult to condense the mile- a- minute plot. 
 seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one. without giving too much away, one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol, tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi- sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion. 
 and it 's all done in a fairly clean, almost( well, maybe not exactly) family fare manner. 
 a grand cast( tomlin, alda, moore, ben stiller, patricia arquette, tea leoni, george segal) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs. 
 drawing from a more hyper woody allen style, the film succeeds beyond expectations.

"i 'm not quite sure how best to go about writing this review. 
 i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson 's political satire"" wag the dog,"" but in retrospect, this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it. 
 quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through, and it did n't do that. 
 they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all- too- true attack on the way the american political media works, and it did n't quite do that either. 
 a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick 's"" dr. 
 strangelove"" in the tradition of political black comedy, and it most definitely did n't do that. 
 that said,"" wag the dog"" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them. 
 the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean( robert deniro) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president, who is up for re- election in two weeks, sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office. 
 the accusations, the script suggests, are probably untrue, but as brean so pointedly puts it, that is n't particularly relevant: the scandal is likely to derail the president 's campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood. 
 brean, along with his assistant( anne heche), decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss( dustin hoffman) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special- effects trickery to make it appear that the u. s. is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor.

 each of the five tells his or her story. 
 their stories are intercut chronologically, starting from normal life in pre- war hungary. 
 they recall the nazi invasion of hungary, being sent to"" work"" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps. 
 they recall their horrible, precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald; the deaths of their family and friends; their loss of hope. 
 each recalls his or her unfathomable, eventual liberation. 
 and finally, the last days shows their cathartic, pained, modern- day return to their old homes and the camps. 
 needless to say, their stories are horrifying, amazing, and emotionally draining. 
 by themselves, the stories would be forceful testaments, but by cutting them in parallel, their impact is multiplied by five. 
 the last days is a talking- heads style documentary -- it 's mostly pictures of people telling their stories, intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage. 
 in this kind of movie it 's almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on- screen, but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific, or at least relevant, images to go with his subjects' narration.

"it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child? whether that may be in life or in death. 
 after having said that, i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well. 
 one gets that choking sensation in the throat( because of grief) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake, or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement. 
 there is no ocean, no drownings 
 and it does not conjure up memories of yet another? 
 ordinary people'. 
 in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing( not that this literally happened in the movie). 
 so what are the lessons learnt: 
 1. do n't take your children to class reunions. 
 2. do n't leave them alone in the lobby, not even for a second. 
 michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly- strung wife and mother, a trend that started with? a thousand acres' and?

 my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie, so much so that when she has a nervous break down, the veins on her temples bulge impressively.

"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski, change the actors, take away the bowling alley, add a record store, and you 've got high fidelity( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby 's novel high fidelity came first). 
 either way, it 's been done before, a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances, yet 
 it remains consistently funny. 
 why is this? 
 maybe because you know your life is much better than this, you know these guys are more pathetic than you are, and you know its ok to laugh at them because they 're fictional. 
 director stephen frears, possibly not intentionally, has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day.

"in brief: best bleak comedy film 
 since heathers. full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture. 
 go see it! 
 so, i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on"" hard copy"" with pam smart, the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980 's. 
"" hard copy"" 's diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman 's fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for. 
 smart replied that she thought kidman 's character came off as a dumb, vicious tramp 
 and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal. 
( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband.) 
 smart 's got a point. 
 it would n't be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well- acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version. 
 however, given a choice between the mass media' happening' of the real event and the fictionalized movie, i would definitely opt for the later. 
 real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart, while pretty and alluring, is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman. 
 to die for begins in a town called little hope, new hampshire, the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb. 
 the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being' on tv.' 
 of course, one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry, played by matt dillon.

"mimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv- show er. 
 her mast famous episode,"" love 's labour lost"", dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child. 
 the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing. 
 there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywood 's big blockbuster movies. 
 so it 's only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster. 
 and i have to say, after a shaky beginning, she does not disappoint. 
 peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists, which is obviously nothing new. 
 the first half hour goes into detail, way too much detail, about how the weapons are stolen. 
 despite a few good images, including a train collision and a very impressive explosion, none of this was very coherent. 
 it 's long and drawn out, and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better. 
 once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture, 
 it begins to take off. 
 george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world. 
 he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters. 
 nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling. 
 there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two, but that is dispensed with quickly. 
 the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe, trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them. 
 clooney goes through bouts of sarcasm, frustration, determination, and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self- doubt. 
 this is when leder starts to show her true stuff. 
 she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer. 
 then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter.

"i have to say it. 
 tim burton 's retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys. 
 ok, that 's off my chest. 
 no more monkey puns, i promise. 
 seriously, though, planet of the apes is one rip- roarin' summer outing, filled with thrills, action, adventure, wit and bits of funny 
( dare i say, monkey) business. 
 i know, i know 
, i promised. 
 and for those film buffs who are fond of the original, burton 's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie. 
 mark wahlberg stars as capt. leo davidson, a deep- space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future. 
 he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted, captured and sold into slavery. 
 despite being darker than the original, burton 's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious. 
 some of the movie 's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton: an organ- grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed. 
 then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter. 
 the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty:"" one thing you do n't want in your house is a human teen- ager,"" he says. 
 you do n't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement. 
 touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton 's brand. 
 lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout: the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian 's foot to try righting himself are:"" take your stinking hand off of me, you damned, dirty human.

 the only person you did n't suspect! 
 however, just because legend does n't really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it ca n't qualify as first- class entertainment. 
 it was, believe it or not, one of the funnest times i 've had at the movies all year. 
 the thing is, i 'm not really sure what made this particular stab( pardon the pun) at the genre seem so fresh and alive.

 more likely, though, it was because of the inspired premise. 
 i do n't think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman.

 an indian wedding is a multi- day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial.

"the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man 's life, especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances. 
 thematically in cinema, love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters; it is rare, however, for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni 's neo- classic drama, life is beautiful. 
 through a central cast of father, mother, and son, benigni demonstrates the wonderful, undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times. 
 life 
* is* beautiful for guido orefice( roberto benigni, directing himself here for the sixth time in his career), an italian jew, master con man, and aspiring waiter extraordinaire. 
 living in 1930 's italy, he lives a carefree life of good fortune; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora( nicoletta braschi). 
 although dora is already engaged, guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead; the two have a child named joshua( giorgio cantarini). 
 unfortunately for the happy family, the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps. 
 it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie 's theme of family love becomes the strongest. 
 although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm, he relaxes the role to ensure his son 's happiness. 
 now, instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora, he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right. 
 benigni 's performance is truly a well- rounded one, and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year.

"while watching wes anderson 's rushmore, it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer, the film 's anti- hero, was not written with jason schwartzman in mind. 
 the young actor, making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman. 
 schwartzman plays max, a student who is more interested in his extra- curricular activities( such as writing edgy plays like"" serpico"" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers) but sees his grades suffer as a result. 
 on the brink of being thrown out, he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross( olivia williams) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume( the great bill murray) to build an aquarium( on rushmore 's baseball field) in her honour. 
 unfortunately for everyone involved, blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well, which gets in the way of max 's plans to woo her. 
 max is one of the best- written characters we 've yet seen in the 90s, and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age. 
 as everyone else has probably already pointed out, he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman( although i was reminded more of paul from"" the wonder years"", from a visual standpoint, at least). 
 hopefully, if he avoids typecasting as weird, quirky loner- types he should earn himself a good career.

"" jude"" is a satirical film from start to finish about society 's way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system, but

 the film takes place in the late 19th century( or early 20th- was n't really sure), but its story could even be retold today in modern form, although it 'd be kinda different( a given). 
 it tells the story of jude( christopher eccleston- the psychotic accountant from"" shallow grave"")- a simple, dim- witted young man with big dreams. 
 in its bleak, foreboding opening, shot in grainy black and white, he gets a lesson from phillotson( liam cunningham), his teacher: as they stand upon a mountain, looking upon a city in the distance, he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world.

"quaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie. 
 he runs into the last dragon in existence, and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth, but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain. 
 eventually, they decide to call a truce, and they work out a deal. since he is the last dragon, he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it. 
 their scam works at first, until they come to a town without any money. 
 instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon, but of course, draco is a nice droagon 
, so he wo n't eat her. 
 there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl. 
 of course, as you can probably tell by the plot, this is a silly movie, but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times, unlike eddie, which was serious all the time. 
 you could probably call this a medieval comedy, because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined. 
 dennis quaid makes a fine hero. 
 pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them. 
 dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl. 
 but lets face it, the movie is really about the dragon, and what an amazing creation he is.

 the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast. 
 it is filled with above- the- title stars. 
 the cast, for the most part, gives great performances. 
 john travolta, whose role is nothing more than a cameo, seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve.

 other plot details, involving a videotape and a biker gang, are irrelevant; in fact, as is the case with most chan films, the plot itself is just about irrelevant. 
 the sole purpose of mr. 
 nice guy 's existence are chan 's comic fight scenes, and those here do not disappoint. 
 director samo hung( who has a cameo role), a longtime collaborator of chan 's, does not waste any time putting chan in action, diving head- on into a wild chase/ fight/ shootout after a brief cooking show prologue.

"the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now:"" it mu5 t be found. 
"" 
 so what, exactly, is the fifth element? 
 after seeing luc besson 's ambitious, much- shrouded- in- secrecy science fiction fantasy, i could not help but be let down by the actual answer, which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think. 
 but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole, a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do -- create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen. 
 the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps -- the actual storyline -- is the most conventional, dismayingly so, element( pun intended) of the film. 
 speaking in the vaguest possible terms, the basics of the plot are as follows: in the year 2259, a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth, and only the four elements -- earth, wind, fire, and water -- united with a fifth element can stop it. figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas( bruce willis); a shady, southern- drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg( the hilariously hammy gary oldman, picking up where he left off in besson 's the professional); a priest( ian holm); and a mysterious creature named leeloo( milla jovovich). 
 all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming -- and unsurprising -- fashion, but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest. 
 what remains interesting and exciting, however, after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil, director of photography thierry arbogast, visual effects supervisor mark stetson, and the crew at digital domain. 
 the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last.

 the groom- to- be is kyle fisher( jon favreau), who is about to be married to the controlling, wedding- obsessed laura( cameron diaz). 
 the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd( christian slater), quiet charles( leland orser), and brothers, michael( jeremy piven) and family man adam( daniel stern). 
 after a wild night of gambling, boozing, and drugs, a stripper( carla scott) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room, but after a freak accident, to everyone 's terror, she is killed. 
 as robert puts it:"" there are two options: go to the police and go to prison, or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her.

 the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film 's two charismatic stars, richard gere and julia roberts, since the story itself is none too original or even believable. 
 the other winning element that makes"" pretty woman 
"" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence, which is rarely as palpable in today 's films as it is here. 
 edward lewis( richard gere) is a suave, extremely wealthy business mogul who, at the start of the picture, breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument, and abruptly takes his friend 's car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel. 
 stopping the car along the street, he asks a woman, obviously a prostitute, for directions. 
 agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks, edward ultimately accepts, they strike up a conversation, and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor.

"the dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients: a witty and whimsical script, inspired performances, a great sense of humor, a large and wonderful cast, and the beautiful scenery of vancouver. 
 it 's a movie of weddings, marriage, family, infidelity, and 
 -- 
 oh yes -- love. 
 like 3 men and a baby, cousins is an americanized version of a french film: 1975 's cousin, cousine. 
 the plot is complicated, but it goes something like this. 
 larry and tom are cousins, each of whom is not- so- happily- married. 
 tom starts an affair with larry 's wife, tish, and to get even, larry and tom 's wife, maria, pretend to have an affair of their own. 
 soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running. 
 cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures. 
 the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role, and virtually every performance deserves mention. 
 ted danson( in his first starring film role) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity. 
 while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on"" cheers,"" he is also complex and vulnerable, with more between his ears than empty space.

"this remake of"" la cage aux folles"" features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son 's future in- laws. 
 the couple( robin williams and nathan lane) are about as archetypal, or as the less kind might put it? stereotypical, gays possible. 
 williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star. 
 they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode. 
 williams is excellent as should be no surprise. 
 gene hackman as right- wing potential father- in- law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles. 
 the real star is lane. 
 his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight- shooting uncle is hilarious. 
 perhaps it is a personal failing on my part, but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and 
 the first few minutes of this film are filled with it.

( for me at least), it does n't last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men, their son and the deception.

"the story of us, a rob reiner film, is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film, as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films.

 the story of us, a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family, is a well written, heartbreaking and insightful film

"warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest, craziest and hard hitting movie in his career. 
 based on a story concocted by himself, and also written by beatty, bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system. 
 beatty stars as senator jay bulworth, who 's going through a nervous breakdown. 
 after hiring someone to kill him, he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what 's_ 
 really_ happening in american politics, much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy( platt.) 
 instead of everyone hating him, the american public love him. 
 however, inside his party, more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin. 
 and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina( berry.) 
 it 's remarkable that this film was released at all. 
 much more open than the rather subdued primary colours, bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name. 
 the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny, and also somewhat true. 
 it 's great that beatty is n't afraid to let loose on a subject. 
 talking of beatty, 
 he 's excellent in the role of the demented senator, clearing having fun. and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed.

"the long and illustrious career of robin williams, which has included both forgettable turns like mrs. 
 doubtfire and flubber, was punctuated with the actor 's first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting. 
 it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989 's dead poets society, and critical remarks were unanimously positive. 
 his next role, that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come, was unfortunately lackluster. 
 and so, after a six- year stint as a comedic actor, the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams. 
 williams is the title character, hunter"" patch"" adams, sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean- shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting. 
 we 're introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies. 
 it 's at the institution, however, that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people. 
 he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia 's medical college, where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating, impersonal trade. 
 his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion, and the movie climaxes with patch 's appearance before the state medical board. 
 the characters are well- defined in an oscar- worthy sense. 
 although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there 's little story to be told outside of patch 's skit- length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters. 
 at medical school, patch meets up with truman schiff( daniel london), an outsider like himself who relishes patch 's zest for humanity. 
 the two instantly become the best of friends, and it 's easy to see why.

 ford plays quinn harris, a carefree and slightly slobby( endearingly so) pilot in the tropics 
 whose broken- down plane crashes in a storm, stranding him and his charter, new york magazine editor robin monroe( anne heche), on a deserted island. 
 of course, the sophisticated robin and the salt- of- the- earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down, and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting. 
 while some of the lines fall flat, the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche. 
 both actors, who have largely done serious works as of late, seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders, and they deliver their zingers, as weak as they sometimes are, with beguiling abandon. 
 naturally, there 's nothing like a life- threatening crisis to bring two people together, and quinn and robin 's warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates. 
 granted, some conflict needed to be introduced on the island, but this tacked- on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes.

 the following year, 1997, saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom: twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia. 
 at best, that 's all it was -- a sleeper hit, designed to surprise but not shake the industry.

 unfortunately, it was saturated with traditional, disney- cute animation, and lost points against the rapidly- changing face of the competition. 
 in making the prince of egypt, dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product. 
 the animation is flawless, and, aside from a bug 's life, is the best- looking movie to date. 
 the animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects, and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with. 
 the key to success, however, was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot. 
 namely, some of the most important action sequences( like the parting of the red sea) were done almost entirely in 3d.

"jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities, but whom you end up liking anyway.

 i mean really mean. 
 the opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium. 
 every day, melvin eats at the same cafe, sits at the same table, and gets served by the same waitress. 
 you can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance, when his waitress carol( helen hunt) tells him he can just go sit in another section, and all the other waitresses just cringe. 
 one day, melvin makes a comment that goes to far, and carol, genuinely hurt, comes down on him like a ton of bricks. 
 at that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course, but is also the only person who can get to him, too. 
 another person who often crosses melvin 's sights is simon( greg kinnear), an artist who lives on melvin 's floor. 
 aside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city, simon has the added benefit of being gay, making him a prime target. 
 simon 's friend frank( cuba gooding, jr.), also gay, does not fare much better.

"the deer hunter, directed by michael cimino, is truly one of the greatest movies ever made. a captivating drama about the lives of a group of friends from a small russian- american pennsylvania community, the deer hunter promises to be one of those movies that you will never forget. 
 in this academy award winner for best picture of 1978, outstanding performances are turned in by all actors, and cimino 's brilliant directing provides the perfect vision into the character 's lives. 
 the first act of the film provides us with an inside look into the lives of a group of men from a small community who work and hang out together. 
 michael, portrayed perfectly by robert de niro, is shown early on as the natural leader of the group. 
 after a days work, the men leave their jobs at a factory to head down to the local bar, where john( george dzundza) works. 
 three of the men, michael, steven( john savage), and nick( christopher walken) will be leaving shortly for vietnam, but not before steven gets married. 
 after the marriage, the group, including axel( chuck aspegren), spend one last day on a hunting trip, one of their favorite past- times. 
 this sequence of events enables us to view the lifestyle of a normal group of men, who will be suddenly and permanently affected by the ravages and separations of war. 
 the wedding scenes, although criticized by many as being quite long, actually enhance even more the purpose of the first act. 
 the outstanding performances by de niro, walken, streep, savage, and cazale, who died very shortly after the filming of the movie was completed, really begin to shine through and promise not to halt in the near future. 
 the second act of the movie begins with the trio of men on the front lines in vietnam, stationed in a south vietnamese village being attacked by the viet cong. 
 the men are eventually captured and held in a floating prison on a river.

"with storytelling this compelling, who needs books? 
 based on the book by author james ellroy, 
 l. a. confidential is probably one of the best piece of work produced by hollywood in recent years. 
 together with director curtis hanson( the hand that rocks the cradle, the river wild) whom ellroy corroborated closely throughout the shooting of the film, resulted in a movie with a plot and and script so tight, an atom would have to squeeze itself through. set in the 50s, the story revolves around 3 policemen of vivid personalities. 
 jack vincennes( spacey) is the cop who is more concerned on busting with fame and stardom ala hollywood style, concentrating heavily on work which will attract him media attention. 
 there is also the young hot- shot rookie, ed exley( pearce), fresh out of the academy and all- out to carve a name for himself in the footsteps of his legendary cop father. 
 the tough and unnerving bud white( crowe), a cop who believes in justice, the swift and violent way. 
 3 policemen, distinct in their characters and paths but all of them working in a place where there is no real distinction between good and evil. 
 when his partner is murdered on the day of his resignation, bud sets out to find the people responsible but unwittingly delved himself into something more than just a simple robbery murder. 
 even after exley receives a promotion for his work on the murder case, happenings began to link itself to the murder. 
 the 3 eventually reach a point of convergence when what actually began as a personal investigation turns out to be an uncovering of a complex web of organised- crime in hollywood. 
 the last time i remember a film so clever and compelling was when i watched the usual suspects. in l. a. confidential, you do not get the shock and cleverness as the former but it has a lot more of` story' going for it. 
 there is not a single moment in the film in which i felt was slow at all.

"synopsis: committed to an asylum 
, the marquis de sade( rush) continues to publish pornographic literature, aided by young maid madeleine( winslet). 
 abbe coulmier( phoenix), who runs the hospital, disapproves of the stories, but humours him in the hope of achieving a cure. 
 de sade 's craft and life are threatened when the emperor dispatches dr royer- collard( michael caine) to stop the marquis' work, permanently. 
 review:"" quills"" is an exploration of the marquis de sade: his madness, his cruelty and his perversion, his obsession with sex in any form, no matter how obscene. 
 but"" quills"" also details the marquis' determination: to write in spite of the obstacles put in his path, and to propagate his words to the masses. 
 the extent to which de sade is willing to go to practise his trade is amongst the movie 's most intriguing elements, as when de sade scribes a story in his own blood, or narrates a tale via of a chain of fellow inmates, cell to cell. 
 to provide a contrast with the marquis, wright involves him with two very different characters. 
 one is the abbe, a handsome, charming and kindly man whose desires are stymied by his oath to god. 
 the abbe lusts for madeleine, but it is the wizened marquis who is able to have her. 
 and then there is royer- collard, a hypocrite who in truth is as sadistic as any of the marquis' motley creations. 
 rush is splendid as de sade, utterly inhabiting the character. 
 kaufman 's direction is fine, and he is able to bring a sense of bizarre humour to the grim proceedings. 
 the plot itself is rather mundane and plays out unsurprisingly, but this is virtually unimportant. 
 for two hours,"" quills"" acquaints us with the marquis de sade -- and, more frightening still, allows us brief insight into his scatological soul.

"with more and more television shows having gay characters, and even the infamous"" ellen"" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian, the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines. 
 the birdcage was critically acclaimed, as was this years chasing amy. 
 then along came in& out, and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released. 
 it 's also noticeable that this"" alternative lifestyle"" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by, and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort. 
 while it 's a very serious issue to many, it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety. 
 but the way we 're using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically. 
 while the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh* at*, it is more and more becoming something we laugh* with*, and when a movie like in& out comes along, it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy. 
 it does n't poke fun at the lifestyle, it simply uses it to all 
 it 's comedic capacity, just as love, sex, marriage, birth, death, and anything else has been. 
 the idea for in& out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids- afflicted gay man in philadelphia. 
 if you remember, during his acceptance speech, hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community, and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life. 
 it 's a serious and touchy subject, but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy, and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick. 
 it 's true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual, it may have been more controversial, but because it was written by an openly gay writer, the prerogative was set.

"with his last two films- shine and snow falling on cedars- australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there, and his latest, hearts in atlantis, is no different. 
 its structure- beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle- is similar to the green mile, which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books. 
 the parallels do n't end there, either. 
 atlantis was adapted by william goldman, who had previously penned the big- screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king 's dreamcatcher. 
 even the film 's content is a bit reminiscent of mile. 
 in fact, it 's the perfect blend of the feel- good' 60s nostalgia of stand by me( also by king) and mystical power hokum of mile. 
 king 's atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories, but the main focus here is on the first( and longest) tale, called low men in yellow coats( the film 's title comes from the second chapter). 
 it 's set in 1960 harwich, connecticut, where 11-year- old bobby garfield( anton yelchin) 
 lives in a boarding house run by his cold, self- centered mother elizabeth( hope davis, joe gould 's secret), who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son. 
 bobby spends his time with his two closest friends, john sullivan( will rothhaar) and tomboy carol gerber( mika boorem), who become something like the kevin, paul and winnie of harwich. 
 when a new tenant moves into the vacant room, the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan( anthony hopkins, hannibal), a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby 's mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror.

 on december 20, 1996, amidst all the year- end oscar bait releases from the major studios, miramax 's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream. 
 although the teen horror market had been given up for all- but- dead in recent years, the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns, eventually topping$ 100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history, while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre. 
 the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly, everybody was looking for hip, inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes. 
 the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost. 
 scream director wes craven, previously best known as the creator of new line 's a nightmare on elm street film series, was thrust back into the limelight. 
 and scream 's rookie scribe, kevin williamson, burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion. 
 it 's hard to understate this last point. 
 mr. 
 williamson has, based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing( scream, i know what you did last summer from october 1997, and now scream 2), enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame, quickly become the most well- known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly- reading, box office figure- watching youth culture since -- well, since that quentin tarantino guy( whom, it is said, has also achieved some renown as a director).

"note: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers. be forewarned. 
 it 's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth. 
 the lion king had just cracked$ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history, continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast. 
 since then, though, disney 's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns, with pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and this year 's hercules successively proving less and less potent. 
 with the once seemingly- impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable, and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox 's anastasia, disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation, the little mermaid. 
 while the animation for the film is, as is typically the case for disney films, unquestionably top- notch, the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation, but 
 the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music. 
 the film 's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man, father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter, teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case, the chaperone is a crab, the teen is a young mermaid, and the object of her desire is a human prince. 
 what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions.

 ralphie 's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood, when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable. 
 evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things` a christmas story' does so well. 
 here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package 
 for everybody during the holiday season: 1) period detail. 
 this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard, who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940 's with loving detail. 
 shepard narrates from a first person point- of- view, divulging his various adventures one snowy december, in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head. 
 shepard 's first- hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious, but also witty and warm, with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing. 
 on top of that, young billingsley 's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration. 
 director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality.

 contact 's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway( jodie foster), a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of"" merely listening"" to sounds out in space. 
 her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age, encouraged by her loving father, ted( david morse), who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola, fl( that was, of course, before the days of internet chat rooms). 
 while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra- terrestrial intelligence( of which the program seti is an acronym for), ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on, keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive.

 this italian film star, best known in the united states for the poorly received son of the pink panther, has done the near impossible by creating a comic fable about the holocaust. 
 but benigni 's life is beautiful( la vita e bella) is not so much a story of the holocaust as it uses that monstrous outrage against humanity as a backdrop to tell a story of familial love, devotion and sacrifice. 
 the movie starts out as a typical slapstick farce with benigni 's guido arriving in the small tuscan town of arezzo in 1938 to fulfill his dream of owning a bookstore.

 among the mayhem, she must also deal with her soon- to- be ex- husband, roger( brian benben) who desperately wants her back. 
 unfortunately, her problems only get worse as the night goes on and the body count rises without explanation. 
 while trying to woo penny back, roger must deal with the police and try to find the killer that lurks at wbn. 
 mary stuart masterson 
 does well in her role as penny( i 'm trying to be unbiased so i wo n't tell you how amazing she looked), although brian benben gets most of the screen time. 
 along with the two leads, are several recognizable faces, including corbin bernsen( l. a. law), michael mckean( laverne& shirley) and bobcat goldthwait. 
 the special effects are amazing, and fooled me( which some may argue is n't very difficult to do) in many scenes. 
 although the movie sometimes goes overboard with the physical comedy, it more than makes up for those mistakes throughout the movie.

"it was with great trepidation that i approached+ mary+, the farrelly brothers+ latest film. 
 i knew the film would be funny -- the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see. 
 but i also knew the film would be an equal- opportunity offender, attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon. 
 i figured the film would be raunchy, maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell.

 surprisingly, the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side, and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers. 
 they make laughter, the toughest job for a filmmaker to do, look easy. 
 the plot is typical. 
 thirteen years ago, geeky ted( ben stiller) lucked out in having dazzling mary( cameron diaz) go with him to the senior prom. 
 as luck would have it, on that very day, he was hospitalized. 
 why, i shall not tell, but i assure you, it isn+t pretty. 
 he hires a private investigator to find her: pat healy( matt dillon). 
 he becomes one of the great comic villains. upon finding her, he too is lovestruck, and so pursues her, lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped. 
 it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double- crossed, and goes to get her for himself. 
 would the geek get the girl? 
 puh- lease. 
 the ending is pure hollywood; no surprises there.

 helen( weaver), after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer, darryl( harry connick jr.), has developed a phobia for being outdoors, so to speak. 
 incidentally, helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers, which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes. 
 a year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco. 
 detective monahan( hunter) and getz( mulroney), baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer, seeks the professional help of helen, who, as expected was reluctant at first. 
 copycat"" borrows"" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases, 
 it did work. 
 but copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability, this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also... 
 much of the time wasted could 've been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama.

 event horizon is not your run- of- the- mill sci- fi film, i 'm sure many who have watched this will agree with me. 
 it is not even original in that sense, and it does borrow heavily from films like alien, hellraiser and even blade runner. 
 the magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build- up that makes it wonderfully horrifying. 
 the story brings us to the year 2050, where space travel have since enormously progressed. 
 the event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man 's lifetime. 
 the ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years, it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune.

"capsule: earthy, experimental, difficult, shockingly frank( even for 1997!), and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops. 
 the first few minutes of sweet sweetback 's baad asssss song( yes, i checked -- 
 that 's the correct number of ss) 
 are without dialogue, just eerie montages of sounds. 
 a young boy, obviously malnourished, is taken in and fed up by several loving mother- surrogate figures. 
 then one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation( underneath the title credits) that 's far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life, something we 're not used to seeing on screen. 
 this is one tough movie to swallow, no matter who you are, but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately. 
( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences.) 
 the plot is simple but not simpleminded. 
 sweetback, hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man, breaks his bonds and runs like hell. 
 along the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all, for that matter: the slums, the missions, the ghetto. 
 in other, lesser, movies, sweetback would be machine- gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies; in this one, we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted.

"a fully loaded entertainment review- website coming in july! 
 i did n't really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family. 
 the movie bombed at the box office, and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based. 
 my real concern, though, was the general reputation of snl- related movies translating to the big screen with less- than- stellar results( half- baked, anyone?) 
 i was surprised to discover a truly entertaining, often hilarious yet also touching little film. 
 it is an al franken production through- and- through, who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture. 
 for those of you who do n't know, al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley, who has a really annoying show on a public- access station about increasing your self- esteem, etc. 
 although not a licensed therapist, stuart smalley is, as the program proudly boasts,"" a graduate of several 12-step programs. 
"" stuart is doing well enough with his tv show, but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles. 
 stuart 's relatives are a mess: his dad and brother( harris yulin and vincent d'onofrio, respectively) are alcoholics, his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce, and his mom is in constant self- denial and solves all perceived problems by baking. 
 then, disaster strikes. 
 stuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked. 
 he is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself, and there the comedy truly picks up. 
 franken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes, but as sharply- drawn, real people. 
 although smalley 's dad has always imbibed too much, stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy. 
 also, after an accident towards the end of the movie, both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought.",positive,"The review praises the movie ""Stuart Saves His Family"" for its entertaining and touching storyline.

 i ca n't decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat, but i 'm pretty sure andrew niccol, screenwriter for the truman show, has had the same curious thought. 
 the truman show is about a man( jim carrey) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public.

"no filmmaker deconstructs a story as well as atom egoyan. 
 i 'm referring, specifically, to the narrative form. 
 in the sweet hereafter, egoyan tells his story in a similar framework to his exotica or the adjuster. 
 said story, of a fatal school bus accident in the small town of sam dent, british columbia, that shatters the morale of the locals, is told in a most unstraightforward manner. 
 when the film opens, the accident has already happened, and stephens( the wonderful holm), a polite ambulance- chaser, has arrived with the promise of a lawsuit that will eek out the truth of what really occurred that fateful morning. 
 throughout, we get to meet the parents of the dead, broken souls who follow stephens like"" the pied piper""( passages of which are read during the film). 
 but there is one living passenger, the paralyzed nicole( polley), whose dark secrets of a life before the accident may affect her decision to testify.

 the movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests. 
 as a young boy, kilmer 's character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork. 
 that is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name, that of a catholic saint.

 the thirteenth floor does n't reach the level of originality, creativity, and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz, but it certainly gives a great shot at it. 
 in the matrix, we were told that the humans are simply a virus. 
 in existenz, we learned that our life could be just a game. 
 in the thirteenth floor, we learn that we are just electronic devices, living under another world of electronic devices. 
 there is just one world on top of another, and everything in them are fake and electronically generated. 
 the thirteenth floor took a huge, risky turn that i did n't expect it to take, and i 'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make. rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film, the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds.

"i 've never been a member of the robin williams fan club. 
 a little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way, and i sometimes feel as though i 'm watching a 40-year- old class clown. 
 in his films, williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy- feely emotion, leading to wildly uneven performances. 
 mrs. 
 doubtfire seemed ready- made for the same problems, but instead it proves to be williams' best comic screen project yet. 
 while it still contains some characteristic self- indulgence, mrs. 
 doubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly- laugh comedy served up with high energy. 
 williams stars as daniel hillard, a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior. 
 one such incident proves one too many for wife miranda( sally field), and she files for a divorce. 
 unemployed, living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children, daniel decides to respond to miranda 's ad for an afternoon housekeeper. 
 he turns to his brother frank( harvey fierstein), a theatrical makeup artist, and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire, a matronly 65-year- old englishwoman. 
 daniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda 's flirtation with a wealthy client( pierce brosnan), to spend time with the children, and to learn something about responsible parenting, all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best. 
 mrs. 
 doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work, and basically it does so. 
 the most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel, and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that 's instantly believable. 
 it may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film, making dustin hoffman 's dorothy michaels look like milton berle.

"weir is well- respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject- matter into deceptively simple, powerful films, the mosquito coast( utopia) and fearless( post- traumatic stress disorder) among them. 
 in the truman show, weir essentially breathes life into the now- tired concept of media- manipulation by tackling the material from the inside- out. 
 it certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top- form playing the title character, truman burbank. 
 by now you must be aware of the premise: unbeknownst to him, truman( carrey) is the star of his own tv series, a 24- 7 peep- show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants. 
` seahaven', his hometown, and the show itself, are the brainchild of christof( harris), who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon, directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras. 
 for 30 years, truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we 're given,' poses christof- but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in` fiji'( mcelhone, who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement) overwhelms him. 
 thus, christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact, lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly- rated program. 
 in a few broad strokes, weir creates a convincing second- reality, and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three- quarters through. 
 this allows us to comprehend and accept truman 's world before we contextualize it. 
 for all his madness, christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship, and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it. 
 truman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be",positive,The review is positive because the reviewer appreciated the performance of the lead actor and the director's ability to create a convincing second-reality.

"synopsis: it 's 1977 in a small italian american neighborhood in new york. 
 disco music is popular, and the sexual revolution is on, but the people of new york are not happy. 
 in fact, they 're terrified. 
 as in spike lee 's do the right thing a heat wave has the city in its grip, and peoples' tempers are flaring. 
 the cool of night offers no respite: the neighborhood is being terrorized by a nocturnal psychotic killer who calls himself the son of sam. 
 no one knows who the son of sam is, and no one is safe. 
 all around new york people are different. 
 aside from cultural groupings and ethnic neighborhoods there are differences between individuals. 
 in the italian american section of town a philandering husband named vinny( john leguizamo) tries to hide his trysts and sexual behavior from his long suffering newlywed wife dionna( mira sorvino). 
 vinny 's friend ritchie( adrien brody) hates disco, works at a gay strip club and does n't want any of the neighborhood folks to know. 
 ritchie 's girl ruby( jennifer esposito) is trying to escape a reputation as a slut. 
 everyone 's different, but nobody in the film wants to be framed as"" alien"" to the community. 
 unfortunately, the killings help create a climate of suspicion pits neighbor against neighbor. 
 opinion: director spike lee 's summer of sam is not about a psycho killer. 
 nor is it about cops trying to apprehend him. 
 it 's about differences and how, given the right conditions, even close neighbors can fan the hostile flames of irrational suspicion. 
 one thing i found interesting in summer of sam was the use of sex. 
 in other movies sex is glamorized. 
 for example, james bond gets a sexual reward for winning.

. a taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting, an intelligent script, and masterful directing, together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days, genuine motivation in a story that rings true. consider the strange coincidence of russell crowe 's character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan 's character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world. 
 i have n't seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah 's masterpiece, the getaway. 
 but enough with the gossip, let 's get to the review. 
 the film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman( david morse), an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti- government soldiers. upon discovering his identity, the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for$ 6 million. 
 the only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off, and no one will step forward with the money. 
 with no choice available to her, bowman 's wife alice( ryan) hires terry thorne( crowe), a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative, to arrange the return of her husband. 
 but when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year: david caruso) take matters into their own hands. 
 the film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and 
 creates a complex and intelligent character- driven vehicle filled with well- written dialogue, shades of motivation, and convincing acting by all the actors.

"i must admit i 'm going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity, because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend. 
 the magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity. 
 i am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre, but something drew me to this film. 
 maybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role, and the hilarious eugene levy. 
 maybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption 
 he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity, con air, and pushing tin. 
 but maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life. 
 the story of serendipity is simple.

"in some regards, making a movie is like trying to stretch a rubber band as far as you can without breaking it. 
 try too hard, and it snaps; but too much reservation means someone else will come along and pull it farther. 
 in simon birch, director mark steven johnson shows us just how to master the technique 
: he takes advantage of caution and poise, but also risks his movie with a few bold steps. 
 in the end, he 's not only holding an unbroken band, but 
 he makes the audience appreciate the lengths he went to direct such a fine feature. 
 there 's no doubt about it: the film that johnson has crafted is rich. 
 he chooses for his setting the quaint town of gravestown, maine- leaves turn bright orange in the fall, the grass is a lush green, pure white snow falls in the winter, and the sky goes on forever. 
 the characters continue that turn: our two leads are simon birch( ian michael smith) and joe wenteworth( joseph mazzello). 
 simon is the smallest baby ever born within the records of the local hospital, and by age twelve he 's only two feet tall. 
 joe is the bastard son of rebecca( ashley judd), and by age twelve he 's ready to know who is father 
 is. 
 naturally, the two outcasts become good friends and share many adventures together, from disrupting sunday school to doing community service to playing little league baseball.

"it 's a fact that a good thriller or action movie does n't need violence to be good or worth watching. 
 all it takes is potential violence to make the audience bite their nails.

"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie. 
 action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences, while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full- circle. 
 for fans of both genres, however, realism is key. 
 action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic, and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie 's end. 
 on this advice, director john frankenheimer( the island of dr. 
 moreau) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller, ronin. 
 the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing, considering the fare that 's fallen into the same category over the last few years. 
 the script, written by j. 
 d. 
 zeik in his big- screen debut 
, approaches levels of complexity 
 that had people spinning away from mission: impossible two years ago. 
 a certain number of people will be lost by this, but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times. 
 frankenheimer masters the script with poise, and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post- cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck. 
 his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here, and ronin becomes a better movie because of it. 
 robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time. 
 he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex- spy sam, a man who 's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre( natascha mcelhone) recover a package.

 the message: a bunch of losers with loser names, mark renton( ewan mcgregor), spud( ewan bremner), sick boy( jonny lee miller), tommy( kevin mckidd), and begbie( robert carlyle). 
 bored, aimless and restless, their routine consists of getting drunk at the local pub, grooving to techno or glam- rock at the local disco and getting shots up the arm at the local den and procuring cash through a variety of methods, some ingenious, others plainly dumb and desperate. 
 not part of the daily dose if obtained, sex is a bonus. 
 you can find these characters as they are, foul- mouthed, dirty, pathetic, ugly perhaps but definitely interesting, in irvin welsh 's cult novel of the same name. 
 what makes the film a completely different experience is how director boyle uses every tool at his disposal to make the filmic medium synchronous with the message. 
 one of the first things you 'll notice is how the camera seems to dart around restlessly. 
 it 'll truck into a character 's pimple, just as soon as it will dolly out to an establishing shot. 
 distracted and curious, it 'll maintain a character 's eye- level or drop right to the ground to show the doped- out- eye- view. 
 you 'll even find characters peering into the camera, their faces smeared across the wide- angle lens. 
 this film camera is just another one of the guys. 
 tiptoeing that indistinguishable line between fantasy and reality, boyle employs a healthy dose of surrealism to get the message",positive,"The review lauds the movie ""Trainspotting"" for its energy, risk-taking filmmaking, and interesting characters.

"steven spielberg 's"" amistad,"" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship, then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who"" owned"" them, is concerned with several different aspects of this story. 
 first, the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery. 
 second, it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case, including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams( anthony hopkins). 
 last, and most importantly, it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade. 
"" amistad"" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements. 
 i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another"" anti- slavery"" movie. 
 having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery, i doubted that there was much i did n't already know about it. 
 fortunately, i turned out to be wrong. 
 for one thing, spielberg 's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa, so"" amistad"" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning. 
 and some of the images here are, in fact, much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery. 
 one scene in the middle, in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their"" excess"" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown, has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year. 
 spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would, and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating.

 and that 's a shame 
- this is a funny, enchanting, and goofy movie full of laughs, surprises, and wonderful dance sequences. 
 the surprising thing about"" shall we dance"" is the universal appeal of the story. 
 a us version is in the works, and it 's no wonder- 
 it 's not really all that culture specific. 
 although there is a narrated set- up that adds some extra resonance to the proceedings( about the view the japanese culture has about ballroom dancing), the movie is so rich in character and appeal that this added layer is n't at all necessary to understand or enjoy the film. 
 the only important unexplained japanese- specific reference that may leave some a bit puzzled is that 1000 yen is roughly$ 10( when you see the film- and you should see this film- you 'll know why). a middle aged company man realizes that achieving all the goals he set for himself in life( a house, a child, and good marriage) still does n't translate into a fulfilled life.

 after finding the weekly fees for private lessons from the elegant and beautiful mai( tamiyo kusakari) too rich for his blood, sugiyama opts for groups lessons simply to be near her.

 what 's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality. 
 you see, disney animated features these days have two components: theme and plot. 
 the theme changes with each new movie; the plot does not. 
 the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped, and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features, they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same. 
 however, while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box- office receipts, merchandising dollars, and glimmers in the eyes of little children, critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer.

 from con air, it was the scene out in the desert when they were digging the plane out from the dirt. 
 in spawn, it was the"" living room hell"" conclusion at the end. 
 in event horizon, it was the video of the event horizon crew being taken over by hell 's forces.

"i must say from the outset that i have never been much of a kurt russell fan. 
 i 've seen some of his films( silkwood, backdraft, unlawful entry) and while he gave adequate performances, i have never been impressed with his work. 
 breakdown, then, is something of a surprise. 
 russell gives a fine performance, as do most of the cast, one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film. 
 to say that he holds the film together would not be completely true, but he does it no harm. 
 russell plays jeff, one half of a married couple travelling with his wife amy( kathleen quinlan) cross country to san diego to start a new job and a new life. 
 while journeying through the desert their car breaks down and, left helpless and stranded, jeff waves down a passing truck driver( j. 
 t. 
 walsh) who offers to take them to a nearby diner to call for a tow truck. 
 because of a nasty incident earlier with a couple of ruffians, jeff decides to stay with the car while amy gets help. 
 that, it seems, is the last time jeff( or anyone else) sees her. 
 breakdown has been compared to several movies: george sluizer 's the vanishing( the original, hopefully, not his appalling hollywood remake), steven spielberg 's duel and any number of hitchcock films. 
 as with these, breakdown does not, for the most part, stray down the conventional path of the american action- thriller. 
 jeff does not become a gun- toting vigilante on the hunt for his wife, but instead becomes a scared, confused everyman who has no idea what the hell is going on. 
 when we do find out what has happened to amy, it does come as a slight disappointment, if only because it 's too early in the film; i for one could have done with an extra twenty minutes or so of mystery and bewilderment, but this affects the film little.

"with the success of the surprise hit alien, directed by ridley scott, a sequel was inevitable. 
 in fact, after watching the first film, a sequel was wanted, particularly by this reviewer. 
 handing over the director 's chair to recent box office gem james cameron, who had only made two films previous to this one( pirahna ii, a surprisingly dull film, and terminator, making cameron a household name), the alien series got a face- lift of immense proportions. 
 instead of being a suspense/ science fiction film, cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture. 
 what results is one of the most terrifying films ever created. 
 a film like aliens comes along only once in a while

 i never saw this movie in theaters, but i wish i could have. 
 the terror and fright must have been unimaginable, most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear. 
 aliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen. 
 with a science fiction plot, cameron gives aliens added testosterone, pumping up the action and fire power from the original film. 
 in fact, aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original. 
 perhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero -- or heroine, as the case may be. 
 never have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film, and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character.

 neophyte lawyer, legal situations, corrupt insurance company, synopsis: rudy baylor( matt damon) is an ethical kid fresh out of law school who must juggle three legal situations at the same time.

 the good news is that this movie has a happy ending, and it features a guy trying to do the right thing.

 in the typical lawyer movie there 's one big case and the movie focuses on solving it, and somewhere along the line surprise witnesses and motives turn up before the good guy wins( after lots of gripping courtroom drama).

 in the background rudy 's voice narrates his feelings and makes half- cynical jokes about the legal profession in general. 
 two factors combine to make this movie less heavy than it can be. 
 first, rudy 's time is split juggling three cases, rather than concentrating on a single high- stakes case. 
 also, rudy 's use of voice narration in place of acting makes the film lose some",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer describes ""The Rainmaker"" as a movie with a happy ending and a protagonist trying to do the right thing.

"susan granger 's review of"" big eden""( jour de fete) 
 it 's utopia, this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana, where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers( nan martin, louise fletcher) eagerly pair off the young people, regardless of sexual preference. 
 there 's nary a homophobe or bigot around, much to the surprise of henry hart( arye gross), a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam( george coe), the ailing grandfather who raised him. 
 and with the simultaneous re- appearance of his best- friend from high- school and object of his unrequited love( tim dekay), now divorced with two young sons, the fact of his homosexuality must be faced. 
 to complete the triangle, there 's 
 the tall, taciturn native american( eric schweig) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam. 
 this fable about home and family is a major debut for first- time film- maker thomas bezucha( a former designer for coach and polo/ ralph lauren) who is meticulous about minding details, using ballads like"" welcome to my world"" and"" achin', breakin' heart"" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved. 
 in the paradise of big eden, what you are does n't matter as much as generosity of spirit, respect and kindness. 
 sure, the plot 's implausible but it 's a good- natured fantasy 
 so allowances should be made. 
 and rob sweeney 's photography of glacier national park is spectacular! 
 on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10,"" big eden"" is a charming, quirky, off- beat

"when you go to the movies as much as i do, you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times. 
 such was the case with frequency. 
 every time i went to a screening, there was the frequency preview. 
 it looked awful. 
 it looked cheesy, sappy and ridiculous. 
 it looked like a flop. 
 well, whoever put that trailer together should be fired, because in terms of pure entertainment, frequency is one of the best of the year thus far. 
 frequency boasts 
 a compelling story line. 
 an occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan( james caviezel) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan( dennis quaid) through a ham radio, despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years. 
 john is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire, but by doing so causes other changes. 
 somehow, a serial killer 's reign of terror, which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders, extends to ten victims... including john 's mother. 
 this is director gregory hoblit 's third film( the other two being primal fear and fallen). 
 with all three, he 's managed to attach himself to great scripts( this one by toby emmerich, whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films) and add equally great direction. 
 also, he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick- ass ending. 
 frequency is no exception, the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying. 
 hoblit is three for three, and i hope he can keep it up.

"it must be tough to be a mob boss.

 after appearing in bottom- of- the- barrel flops, father 's day and my giant, crystal finally finds a reliable costar and some very promising material here. 
 playing vitti 's private shrink, the two very different stars strike an unorthodox, but interesting relationship that carries this enjoyable comedy on a steady wave of laughs from start to finish. 
 casting robert deniro as paul vitti is something of an in- joke, i think. 
 placed in this mobster 's shoes, deniro gets to spoof characters he himself played in films like the godfather, part ii and casino. 
 it 's obvious he 's having a lot of fun doing so. 
 the man behind the camera is harold ramis, whose credits include ghostbusters( as writer and star), and his best directing effort, the bill murray vehicle, groundhog day. 
 ramis has a knack for drawing laughs because he simply knows what 's funny, and here he manages to accentuate the strengths of nearly all the actors. 
 the only character who weakens the payoff is crystal 's bride- to- be( lisa kudrow). 
 playing the same dumbed- down role as she does in friends, kudrow is amusing, but does n't fit into this comedy mold as well as the director may have hoped. 
 the supporting cast sparkles.

"expand the final fifteen minutes of home alone into a feature- length film and you 've got baby 's day out -- an agreeably amusing children 's comedy about a bumbling band of kid kidnappers who are unwittingly outwitted by an innocent infant. 
 the plot tracks a trio of crooks- posed- as- photographers( mantegna, pantoliano, haley) who steal nine- month- old bennington august cottwell iv, aka baby bink, from his old- money home. 
 but the plan goes awry when baby crawls out an open window and into the streets of downtown chicago! 
 following the path of his favorite story, called"" baby 's day out,"" baby rides a bus and visits the zoo and winds up at a skyscraper construction site.

"waiting at the train station near the beginning of fury, joe says:` after all, we 're human.' 
 in the context of events to transpire, joe 's line is prophetic, foreshadowing the internal conflict of the protagonist in the latter half of the film. 
 does being human necessarily imply humane behavior? 
 through the baseness of human character exemplified in the formation of a mob, fritz lang prompts the viewer to consider whether our inclination towards impulsiveness supersedes our civility. expressing his abhorrence towards the rise of nazism in his homeland, lang takes great care in creating a sense of discomfort during the scenes of mob hysteria. 
 in the scene prefacing the lynching, the mob achieves critical mass at the bar. 
 deputy meyers is brought in as an exalted informant, but when he is unable to augment the mob 's myth of joe, he is quickly renounced from his position as town gossip. 
 we see in a shot where two bar patrons are arguing that the deputy looks around nervously at the growing monster and then carefully slips out of the bar. 
 what is quietly horrifying is the realization by both the audience and the deputy that the crowd no longer exists within the confines of reason and has succumbed to what the barber referred to as impulse. 
 what once was excitement to the deputy has turned into fear with the realization that he is now powerless. 
 to the audience, the deputy 's quiet exit concurs with their own sinking feeling of uneasiness as the mob 's delirium crescendos. 
 lang educes this discomfort not through movement of the camera, but rather its stillness. 
 the shot 's composition places the audience equidistant and directly across from the pair of arguing patrons and the deputy effectively becomes a mirror to our own apprehensions. 
 as the intensity of the mob closes around deputy meyers, it does so around the viewer as well. 
 the stationary camera in this shot heightens our fears because when the deputy escapes, we are deserted by our reflection and the viewer becomes the sole proprietor of sensibility amongst a swarm of irrationality.

"because the press screening of"" planet of the apes"" was one day past last issue 's deadline, i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time, listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece. 
 the chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance, that the story was thin, that mark wahlberg 's character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked. 
 to those people i would like to say? 
 what the hell did you expect? 
 this is a tim burton movie, boys and girls. 
 tim burton movies have great art direction and thin, clunky stories.

 burton 's re- imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great. 
 the apes, courtesy of make- up magician rick baker, are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold. 
 like astronaut leo davidson( wahlberg), the film hits the ground running, whisking viewers through a head- spinning series of solid one- liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later. 
 as for wahlberg, consider what burton does with his character. 
 from his start as a filmmaker, burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits( pee- wee herman, the joker, ed wood, the ack- acking martians, etc.) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes.

 this unpretentious little comedy, which sneaks into theaters today with very little hype,

 how scientists were so accurately able to predict when this catastrophic event would occur is never explained.

 throughout the entire movie, no explanation is given as to why this is happening. 
 in doing this, mckellar( who also wrote and directed the film) seems to be trying to transcend the genre. 
 he 's attempted to make a film about people, and how each of them deals with their last night of life. 
 the film contains no science fiction elements, which allows the viewer to concentrate on the feelings and actions of the characters. 
 mckellar is largely successful in his attempt to rise above his material. 
 the film is set in toronto, and follows several people in their various escapades on the last night of existence. 
 there 's mckellar, who plays a man who just wants to be alone when the moment occurs, but keeps getting interrupted by a woman( sandra oh) in search of her husband. 
 her husband, played by david cronenberg, is spending the day working at the gas company, informing people that they will attempt to keep providing gas right up until the end.

" a bug 's life"" may not be"" toy story,"" but it 's more close than"" antz"" was. 
 i really liked"" antz,"" basically because, yes, it is clever and witty and intelligent( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead, perhaps the year 's most inspired casting), but there was, in fact, something missing from it, and i 'm the first to admit that. 
 maybe it 's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun 
- 
 it 's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging, and if it were n't for woody allen, it would have been just a really clever good- not- great flick. 
"" a bug 's life"" has a similar premise, and it also has disney to insure that it 's g- rated and not totally over kids' heads like"" antz"" was( not a bad thing, believe me), but what it also has is a tone that 's completely innocent even when it 's also remaining perpetually clever. 
"" antz"" is still the more witty film, and i love it for it, and"" a bug 's life"" is more for general consumption, but it 's also more entertaining.

"when i saw the trailer for"" the sixth sense,"" i did n't expect much from it. 
 my snap judgment was that it was a watered- down version of"" the shining"" or possibly a late- entry in the glut of angel- related movies/ tv shows of a couple years ago. 
 but all the buzz motivated me to give it a shot. 
 it turned out to be one of the most satisfying movie experiences of the year. 
 bruce willis plays child psychologist malcolm crowe. 
 at the beginning of the movie, he is admiring an award the city has given him for his work, but he is soon confronted by vincent, a patient malcolm failed years earlier( donnie wahlberg- former new kid- in an impressive cameo). 
 a year passes, and malcolm is treating another child with the same symptoms vincent displayed. 
 cole sear( haley joel osment) is a withdrawn kid who is called"" freak"" by the other boys in the neighborhood. 
 weird things seem to happen around cole- his mother( olivia williams) leaves the kitchen for a moment and returns to find every cabinet and drawer open even though cole has n't moved- and cole seems to know things that a kid his age 
 shouldn't- for example, that there was once a gallows in his school. 
 he steals religious icons from churches to build a chapel in a pup tent in his bedroom. 
 the trailer gave away the movie 's first major plot twist.

"the happy bastard 's 30-second review big daddy happy gilmore as a father? 
 of course! 
 that 's the latest scenario presented by adam sandler in the new movie big daddy, a movie that 's passable but is n't really considered some of sandler 's best work. 
 he does n't actually play happy gilmore in the movie, but a variation of him. 
 he 's sonny coufax, a man who 's living off a settlement he got for a cab running over his foot and his one- day- a- week gig as a tollbooth man( tollbooth willie?). 
 his girlfriend( kristy swanson) is fed up with his lifestyle and demands a change before she leaves him. 
 enter a 5-year old kid, who 's mysteriously dropped at his doorstep and intended for his preppy roommate( jon stewart), who 's off in china on a business trip. 
 from there, coufax basically acts as the kid 's father, teaching him different things like peeing on the side of a building and tripping up skateboarders with sticks. 
 he even manages to use the kid in a sort of con game to get the attention of a beautiful law office worker( joey lauren adams), but, somehow, he also garners the attention of social services, who are n't particularly pleased with coufax 's actions, as he pretends to be his roommate to keep the kid. 
 the reason i say it 's not really sandler 's best work is because it gets really sappy towards the end of a movie, showing some odd feelings that somehow did n't really belong in a sandler vehicle.

" 
 six days, seven nights"" is a summer movie that gets the summer movie experience deliciously right, a commendable achievement considering the season thus far has been littered with some pretty uneven fare. 
 here 's a genuinely fun fluff piece that knows it 's fluff, recognizes it 's fluff and is admittedly proud to be fluff. 
 of course, the casting of harrison ford in the broadly comedic lead role plays a sizeable part in the movie 's success; ford is such a concentrated dramatic actor that it 's easy to forget what a funny guy he can be. 
 as his female counterpart, anne heche also deserves a big pat on the back for her sweet, goofily charismatic performance. 
 the age difference( ford 's 56, heche 's 29) matters not -- these two click in a charged way that 's hard to come by. 
 the story is a no- brainer -- ford stars as gruff but loveable island aviator quinn harris, while heche is career- minded but loveable new york magazine editor robin monroe. 
 robin, on a tropical vacation with fianc? 
 frank( david schwimmer), gets assigned to supervise an emergency photo shoot in nearby tahiti 
, so she reluctantly hires quinn to fly her there. 
 the plane crashes during a terrible storm, and they immediately find themselves stuck in a deserted paradise with few ideas on getting back to civilization. 
 a series of unpleasant, often hilarious catastrophes leaves little choice but for both members of this unlikely odd couple to fall for each other. 
 meanwhile, back at the resort, frank is tempted himself by quinn 's shapely female tagalong( jacqueline obradors). 
 that subplot obviously exists to get us rooting for the quinn- robin pairing, and while it makes for a few good laughs early on, it eventually becomes a contrived distraction from the far more engrossing misadventures of quinn and robin. 
 and since the film spends most of its time with the castaways, this flaw is only a minor inconvenience.

"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king 's work. 
 this slow- moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals, but suffers from a tepid conclusion, inconsistent direction, and may not have wide commercial appeal. 
 when the maid, dolores claiborne, is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer, it seems like an open- and- shut murder case. 
 upon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax, dolores' estranged and bitter daughter, esquire magazine writer selena st. 
 george, returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home. 
 as the two clash horns, the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago, ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey, is revealed. 
 did dolores kill her husband? 
 and did she kill her employer? 
 dolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller. 
 consequently, it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood 's finest character actors, such as bates, leigh and strathairn.

" being john malkovich"" is the type of film we need to see more. 
 today 's films are either blockbusters that entertain us with tiresome formulas, or those that have similar themes. 
 malkovich falls under none of these categories, and it 's quite refreshing to see that occur. 
 this strangely provoking story, is actually somewhat understandable. 
 john cusack plays a puppeteer trying to make it to the big time. 
 his wife( cameron diaz) supports the both of them by working at a petstore, which explains the obscure pets they keep in their apartment. 
 when cusack finally realizes he needs to get a job, he finds an ad for a filing clerk.

 it 's there that he discovers a secret portal that leads to being john malkovich for 15 minutes at a time. 
 meanwhile, cusack meets a business partner( catherine keener), in which he falls madly in love with her. 
 the only problem is, she has no interest in him 
 what so ever. 
 the whole portal thing, is n't just a toy, in fact, it becomes cusack 's dream.

 intrigued by her melancholy demeanor( and slightly infatuated with her), sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and, much to his amazement, ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei. 
 meanwhile, sugiyama 's wife( hideko hara) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights, and sets a private detective on her husband 's trail.

 the tailor of panama"" is a different kind of spy movie. 
 despite the presence of pierce brosnan, there is nary a hint of james bond flash here. 
 instead of big action scenes, leering super villains and empty- headed femme fatales, we get interesting characters and an intriguing situation. 
 based on the novel by john le carr?, who also co- wrote the screenplay, the film offers viewers something rarely seen in theaters this time of year: a solid, well- told story. 
 brosnan plays andy osnard, a british operative walking on thin ice. 
 his british superiors ship him off to panama, making sure he understands that he had better not screw up the placement. 
 osnard arrives in the tropics virtually oozing contempt for his new co- workers and his new home base. 
 when shown the bridge of the americas by a person marveling over the fact that, since the creation of the panama canal, the structure is the sole connection between north and south america, he barely keeps from yawning. 
 brosnan clearly relishes the chance to be the antithesis of 007, investing the suave spy with a distinct reptilian quality coupled with an air of indifference that irks his fellows to no end. searching for a way to get information on the government, osnard sets his sights on harry pendel( geoffrey rush), an unctuous tailor serving the panamanian elite. 
 harry claims to be a transplant from britain 's renowned saville row, but osnard knows his secret: the tailor is an ex- con who served five years in prison after torching his uncle 's shop in an insurance scam. 
 he also knows that harry is up to his ears in debt, having spent a fortune on an unsuccessful farm.

"perhaps it 's time for me to say a little about my reading habits. 
 i really do like to read, and i 've enjoyed many books in my lifetime. 
 my problem is that i 'm a slow reader, and not very dedicated -- i 'll enjoy portions of a book and then set it down for months at a time 
( it 's taken me the last six weeks to get through the first one hundred pages of anna karenina, even though i 'm loving the book). 
 in addition to this, i typically do n't read anything created after the 19th century. 
 the only reason i bother with this bit of information is because i feel bad admitting, time after time, that i have n't read any of the books on which these films are based( the only exception, i believe, is great expectations). 
 however, i do n't think it should be necessary to read the book beforehand in order to judge the quality of the film. 
 needless to say, i have n't read the elmore leonard novel out of sight, on which steven soderbergh 's new film is based. 
 i ca n't say how faithful of an adaptation it is, or if it lives up to leonard 's vision. 
 i can say that it 's a terrific film, with sharp acting, great dialogue, and pumping full of energy and style injected by soderbergh. 
 it 's certainly a nice distraction from 1998 's lineup of brainless blockbusters, all hopelessly wishing that size mattered. 
 out of sight proves that it does n't. 
 i had originally written george clooney off as a one- note actor, incapable of depth but occasionally showing a little flair. 
 after seeing his latest performance in this film, i 've changed my mind -- 
 this guy can act, but he also has that forceful presence that most certainly will make him one of those$ 20 million superstars.

 he does it because it 's fun

"note: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers. be forewarned. among my fanatical ticker tape- worshipping friends, there 's one who happens to share the same philosophy espoused by the central character in darren aronofsky 's darkly original pi: the entire stock market can be reduced to nothing but a series of patterns which, through analysis, will produce information to accurately forecast future behaviour.

 while i freely admit that i know less than nothing about the market( knowledge check: 
 prices up -- good; prices down -- bad; most of the time, at least) and hence really could n't comment with any authority, it 's always nonetheless struck me as an incredibly naive oversimplification of an astonishingly complex system( and besides, if it were that simple, no doubt somebody would 've already figured it all out). 
 the difference in this case is that while my colleague( an otherwise assuredly realistic individual) truly believes in this in and of itself as a valid forecaster, pi uses this ideology as a device with which to investigate its character 's psychosis. 
 it 's also vastly more convincing with its argument.

"kadosh means sacred in hebrew. 
 amos gitai 's fictional work, after spending most of his career doing documentaries, is a grim story about a failed hasidic marriage, even though the marriage is a loving one. 
 the marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli 's modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic 's intolerable one, as both groups are vying for control of the secular government. 
 gitai( devarim/ yom yom) is a labor party leftist, who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government, it would sound the death knell of israel.

 that if they ever got control of the country, their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are. 
 the story takes place in jerusalem 's jewish quarters called mea shearim, where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls, and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life, which is much different than the way most jews live in israel.

 most of these characters are either unemployed or work jobs that are apparently too menial to be worth mentioning. 
 their lifestyle is a sort of passive resistance to the idea that people should go out and actively pursue a career after graduation; they seem content to sit around spouting off about the inadequacy of american democracy, the pervasiveness of slave morality, the subtle messages in pop culture, and such.

 turner is the woman caught between the two men. 
"" 
 a breed apart"" is n't a bad movie, exactly. 
 indeed, i found myself rooting for both the hauer and boothe characters, even though their goals could n't be more different. 
 the problem with the film is that there are just too many inconsistencies. 
 for example, early on in the film, hauer physically assaults two drunken rednecks shooting at"" his"" birds. 
 later on, the rednecks come back for revenge with four other people, and hauer kills a few of them. 
 i have a tough time believing that the police would n't get involved at that point.

 but sadly, titanic just misses the mark of masterpiece( although it is one of cameron 's best films) 
 the film starts with present day explorers searching the runied titanic. 
 they find a safe, and inside a picture of a woman. 
 the woman in the picture( an old winslet) tells the explorers that the picture is of her. 
 the explorers invite her over, and she then tells her story of titanic.

 also boarding the ship is rich woman rose dewitt bukater( winslet) who is being forced into a marriage with a man she dosen't love at all, cal hockley( zane) so her family can remain rich. 
 she nearly commits suicide on the ship, but jack comes to the rescue, saves rose, they fall in love, and cal gets jealous and eventually tries to kill them. 
 oh yeah, and the ship sinks.

"on seeing the outrageous previews for bulworth one wonders what plot could possibly allow beatty get away with making those statements( in case you missed it, warren beatty plays a politician on the campaign trail. 
 he says to a black congregation""... 
 if you ca n't cut down on malt liquor and chicken wings and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife, you 're never gon na get rid of me."") 
 well, there is such a plot, and 
 it works very well in this comedy. 
 beatty plays jay billington bulworth, a long- time democratic senator from california. 
 the movie opens on a painfully repetitious montage of bulworth 's latest commercials condemning affirmative action. 
 the montage is ironically intercut with pictures of martin luther king and bulworth in his youth working with jack kennedy. 
 when we finally lay eyes on bulworth he is morosely weeping in front of his tv, having gone without food or sleep for days. 
 his campaign is entering the final weekend before the primaries but his depression has sunk in too far for him to care. 
 first he calls a lobbyist from the insurance industry to get a bribe- a$ 10 million life insurance policy in his daughter 's name. 
 then he calls an associate to arrange for his own assassination. 
 his assistant murphy( oliver platt) is oblivious to bulworth 's suicidal state and drags him to his speaking engagements. 
 bulworth halfheartedly reads his speech at an african- american church, then takes questions from the audience. 
 he is hit hard with questions about his voting record. 
 he had promised money to help rebuild the community after the riots, and it has n't shown up. 
 since he 's a dead man anyway, he figures he 'll answer truthfully: he and bill clinton and newt gingrich came to l.

 they made some promises that improved their public image for a while, and then counted on the media and the public to eventually forget about the promises they made.

"american pie acknowledges a cold, hard fact that most movies do n't: it is very difficult to get laid. 
 its four virgin heroes are jim( biggs), a chronic masturbator, kev( nicholas), who desperately wants to deflower his girlfriend( reid), oz( klein), a lacrosse player whose approach requires some fine tuning, and finch( eddie kaye thomas), a germphobe( his crass nickname is hilarious, but i wo n't spoil it here) who pays a classmate to spread rumours about the size of his member. 
 jim, kev, oz and finch attend a high school in suburban michigan full of so many impossibly beautiful women

 after a party at their studly friend stifler 's( seann william scott, in the film 's sharpest performance) house leaves them sexually unsatisfied, the quartet make a pact: to"" lose it"" by graduation- specifically, prom night, which is only a few weeks away. 
 american pie is in the tradition of bachelor party or revenge of the nerds. 
 almost every conversation these characters have revolves around makin' whoopee.

"the 1998 summer movie season is still in its infancy. 
 but after diasappointing films such as"" godzilla"" and"" fear and loathing in las vegas"", it would be nice to see a really good film. 
 but i doubt you could have expected this. 
 the truman show is one of the most unique films i have ever seen, and it deserves a spot on the"" decade 's best"" list. 
 there is no way to isolate any single component of this picture and proclaim, 
"" yes, that 's what makes this film great. 
"" 
 the blend of peter weir 's masterful( and in many ways brilliant) direction, peter biziou 's stunning photography and jim carrey 's performance is what makes this film work so fantastically 
. 
 there is something strangely beautiful about every shot in the truman show. 
 it may be the use of color or the placement of characters in the frame, but everything about this film looks intentional and perfect. 
 carrey has made a very wise choice. 
 by playing mild- mannered truman burbank, he allows himself enough room to be comical, and therefore not alienating his true fans, while still showing a vulnerable and human side. 
 that is a side which has been missing from nearly every major character he has played in his numerous commercial successes. 
 truman burbank was born to an audience of millions. 
 he was chosen before birth to be the focus of a 24 hour television show. 
 everything in his environment is controlled by a team of technicians, led by the show 's director, christof( played by ed harris). 
 everyone in truman 's life is an actor or an extra. 
 they are all being watched by millions of people around the globe, people who can tune in at any time of the day to see what is happening in truman 's life. 
 but he is the only person that is not aware of it. 
 the classification of the truman show may be tricky. 
 the audience reacted to many of truman 's revelations with laughter.

"one way of telling if a film is good or not is by the length. 
 if a film is only 90 minutes, but feels like 300 minutes, then it 's crap. 
 but if a film last 2 1/2 hours, and feels like 90 minutes, then it 's excellent. 
 boogie nights falls into the latter catagory.

 jack horner( reynolds) is a adult film director, who decides that eddie would be great in the adult movie business. 
 after running away from home, eddie joins jack, changes his name to dirk diggler, and starts making erotic movies. 
 in the movie business, dirk meets a whole load of characters( which the film introduces very quickly and slickly) such as scotty( phillip seymour hoffman), rollergirl( graham) amber( moore) and floyd( phillip baker hall), and little bill( william h. macy) 
 all the characters are well written, well played, and the audience gets to know them pretty well, thanks to the excellent script. 
 we learn about ambers grief about not being able to see her child due to a divorce, rollergirls hard time at school, and little bills wife, who sleeps with everyone except her husband. 
 but the best thing about the excellent boogie nights is paul andersons direction and writing. 
 the direction is fast, thrilling, and never holds up. 
 there are some great shots, some lovely steadiocam and handheld camera sequences, and lots of other neat directional touches.

"it 's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director 's cut of the film. 
 films such as aliens, the abyss, the wild bunch, blade runner, and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker 's integrity, later chopped up or mucked with by the studio. 
 the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films. 
 the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson 's 1995 masterpiece the professional, which is known as l? on around the world, is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic

"while it was part of former yugoslavia, my country, croatia, used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general. 
 words"" croatia"" and"" croatians"" were unheard, even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations. 
 the rare exception was the dogs of war, 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth 's bestselling novel, yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury, by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context. 
 in a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people, probably terrorists, who happen to remove parts of arm dealers' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise. 
 same line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place- dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business, politics and crime. 
 the movie protagonist, shannon( christopher walken) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe. 
 his latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro. 
 shannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba, bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away.

 upon return, he is approached by mining company again, but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d'etat against kimba.

"the happy bastard 's quick movie review analyze this how does one do a comedy focused on the mob? 
 well, a few years ago, there was a sly little comedy called the freshman, which had marlon brando doing a romp of a send- up of his famous don corleone character and, recently, the utterly stupid( in a bad way) movie mafia! failed to really get the joke. 
 this time around, however, warner bros.

 more than it misses. 
.. 
 and for plenty of reasons. 
 the story goes like this. 
 a mobster( robert deniro) finds himself receiving several panic attacks as of late, fueled by the stress of an upcoming mobster meeting and a near- death following a drive- by shooting. 
 it 's these attacks that prompt him to hire a psychiatrist( billy crystal) who 's mostly reluctant to take the mobster 's case for two reasons. 
 first, of course, he 's a mobster, but secondly, he 's trying to get married and enjoy a quiet honeymoon with his wife( lisa kudrow) and kid. 
 and, of course, he ca n't rest worth for a moment because the mobster 's goons are always needing the shrink for something, be it a quick consultation or dream analyzation. 
 fortunately, the movie is played out for plenty of laughs. 
 director harold ramis( who also helmed the comedy multiplicity, which was n't half bad) keeps the tone peppy and light, even if it 's sometimes sprinkled by slight dramatic moments( shootings ca n't always be taken for laughs, you know). 
 deniro 
 does some of his finest comic work since the king of comedy, giving off a somewhat similar performance to his role in goodfellas, but with a bit of a lighter heart.

 he has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab, which is off limits to her, as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice, convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses.

"written by john grisham and robert altman( as al hayes) directed by robert altman some time ago, a young director was given the opportunity to direct the screen version of a popular novel. 
 the novel was a summer smash, topping best- seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads. 
 the only problem: the novel was n't very good. 
 it was far more pulp than pulitzer. 
 but the director realized that, no matter how pedestrian the prose, this book really grabbed people- that the author, while not a great writer, was a fantastic storyteller. 
 so he took on the project, convinced he could make something happen on screen. 
 the director? 
 francis ford coppola. 
 the book, of course, was mario puzo 's the godfather. 
 the rest, as they say in showbiz, was history. 
 by bringing up the godfather, i do n't mean to suggest that robert altman 's the gingerbread man is destined for that level of greatness. 
 but the parallel does suggest that it is possible to create great cinema from questionable source material. 
 can you get any more questionable than john grisham? 
 depends on whom you ask. 
 but there 's no question that grisham 's work grabs people. 
 like puzo, grisham is a better storyteller than a writer- unlike fellow hack michael crichton, who is a good idea man but who ca n't tell a well- constructed story from a can of spam. 
 so something in grisham 's unpublished story of a cocky savannah lawyer who gets involved in a deadly family squabble drew the attention of robert altman, who at 73 years old remains one of america 's greatest living filmmakers. 
 the result is a gripping thriller that, while falling short of classic cinema, deserves its place in the altman canon. 
> from its opening shot to the closing credits, the gingerbread man is permeated with a sense of dread, with a fear of the natural destructive forces of the universe.

"october sky is a rare oddity in cinema: a self- proclaimed"" uplifting"" film that is actually uplifting! 
 based on the autobiographical book by homer hickam, rocket boys, october sky tells the struggle of four boys reaching for their dream. 
 it 's 1957, and for the boys of coalwood, west virginia, there 's not much hope of a rosy future. 
 coalwood is a coal mining town, and, except for the few lucky ones who manage to escape on a football scholarship, most of coalwood 's boys are destined to work in the mine. 
 but, in october 1957, an event happens that sparks one boy to dream. 
 the launch of the soviet satellite sputnik sets homer hickam( jake gyllenhaal) to dream a future of rocketry and space travel. 
 of course, homer 's parents( chris cooper and natalie canderday) are n't quite sure what to make of their son 's unusual interests. 
 homer gets his strongest encouragement from miss riley( laura dern), a teacher in his school who also informs him about the scholarships offered to the winners of a national science fair. 
 and so, with stars in his eyes, and thoughts of scholarships in his head, homer enlists the help of three other boys( william lee scott, chad lindberg and chris owen) and begins to build a rocket. 
 but, do 
 these four backwoods boys even have the slightest hope of escaping their destiny? 
 there is a lot that could have gone wrong with october sky. 
 nearly every sequence flirts with becoming syrupy and cliched. 
 however, miraculously, october sky 
 avoids nearly all of these pitfalls, making the exact right moves at the exact right times. 
 a film emerges which manages to be powerful and moving without slipping into the gauzy haze of nostalgia or sliding down the sugarry slope of sappiness. 
 jake gyllenhaal is outstanding as the kid at the center of this film. 
> from the outset of the film, he is immediately likable, and never seems too corny or brainy as to alienate the audience",positive,"The reviewer praises the film for being genuinely uplifting and for its portrayal of the protagonist's struggle and dream.

"while watching boiler room, i was constantly reminded of last year 's masterpiece fight club. 
 both films consist of a predominately male cast. 
 both films follow young men as they illicitly fight the traditional system for their own desires. 
 and both films are seen through the eyes of one narrator, who eventually realizes that these men have to be stopped. 
 while boiler room writer/ director ben younger does not get his point across as well as david fincher does for fight club, he does contribute another impressive work to a series of films aiming to represent the new generation. 
 a generation which has seen the internet prosper and where everyone wants to be a millionaire. 
 paying homage to oliver stone 's 1987 classic wall street, younger is almost modernizing the tale by using younger, hipper actors to play the greedy villains as opposed to the older, more experienced types. 
 as is true in real life, younger minds are becoming richer and richer from their knowledge of more standard technology. 
 boiler room dismisses the notion of ingenuity and shows that greed and desire for power come in all ages. 
 another similarity with fight club is that both films are not action flicks. 
 some people are convinced that an all- male cast automatically means there must be gory violence, here is proof that this is not true. if you want to see an action movie starring ben affleck, go see reindeer games this weekend. if you want to see a smart, insightful film with excellent acting and a clever script, see boiler room. 
 giovanni ribisi gives an outstanding performance as the film 's narrator, seth. 
 after dropping out of college and running a lucrative gambling center for college students in his apartment, seth is offered a high paying job by a wealthy man( nicky katt). 
 he agrees to take the job( in which you are guaranteed to become a millionaire within three years) of selling stock to well- off americans from the mid- west over the telephone and begins to fit in quite well with his co- workers.

"ok, let 's get one thing 
 straight right away: maximum risk is no battleship potemkin( although it does have some russians in it!), but it 's not too bad, really. 
 it 's the new film from ringo lam, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood, and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium, jean- claude van damme( who, you will recall, also starred in john woo 's maiden hollywood effort, hard target). 
 in lam 's film, van damme plays alain moreau, a french cop( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians. 
 these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york( where, i suppose, they thought they would n't be noticed). 
 this brother, mikhail suverov( played in his few scenes by... 
 well, you know), becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi( almost the same thing, i guess), and is killed in france( in the movie, things happen so fast that you do n't have too much time to think about how weird this all is). 
 moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed, and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed( we wonder the same thing; i still do). 
 in little odessa, he meets mikhail 's girlfriend, alex( natasha henstridge, last seen in species), who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise- en- scene( she has very nice breasts, and we get to seen them briefly in this movie; it was rated r in the us but is pg here, so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do).

"trailing the success of brit humour in the movie industry with the likes of the semi- dramatic the commitments and the nearly slapstick a fish called wanda, the full monty is one film which delivered the depth of the former and the humour magnitude of the latter. 
 the film opens with a narrated documentary reel showing the improving economic and living standards of sheffield in the 60 's, then cut to the harsh reality of the present. 
 sheffield has become some sort of a semi- slum with the only visible increase in anything was the amount of layoffs from steel- factories; 
 a once flourishing industry. 
 gaz( carlyle) spends most of his time in the worker 's club, a sort of place where jobless people sit around to wait for job offers. 
 he and his` plump' friend dave( addy) as well as their former foreman gerald( wilkinson) have been sitting around the club for months without any` call for duty'. 
 what seemingly was just a passing hard time for gaz suddenly transformed itself into desperation when he can not afford the 700 pounds of child- support money to his ex- wife. 
 suddenly finding himself facing the possiblity of losing custody of his son, he goes on to concoct an enterprising wild- idea to get the money he desperately requires.

" 
 you 'll go ape over tarzan because it 's more fun than a barrel of monkeys! 
"" 
 okay, there 's the quote in case disney wants to put something in their ads for the movie. 
 disney 's latest animated feature throws us right into the action from the very beginning, skipping the usual main title sequence and putting us on pitching waves as a small family attempts to escape from a sinking ship. 
 father, mother, and infant somehow make it to shore amidst a rousing song by phil collins, and have soon built a treehouse which would impress the swiss family robinson. 
 it 's amazing, the kinds of things you can do when you work to a soundtrack. 
 before you know it, an unfortunate set of circumstances put the baby in the hands of kala( glenn close), a mother ape who recently lost her own baby to a predatory leopard. against the wishes of her mate and family leader, kerchak( lance henricksen), she takes on the infant boy as her own. 
 tarzan is not so much a story about a human boy surviving in the african jungles as it is about one who does not really fit in either humanity or the wild. 
 much of tarzan 's young life is spent trying to become one of the apes in the eyes of his peers and his"" father,"" which occasionally gets him into trouble no matter how well- meant his attempts. 
 all he 's looking for is acceptance, perhaps a goal easily identifiable by young viewers, but one which will ring true with a lot of adults. 
 when you really think about it, this story fits right into the disney formula of the outcast that triumphs in the end. 
 look back on past disney animated features and you 'll see the trend. 
 growing up, tarzan( voiced by alex d. 
 linz as a child, and by tony goldwyn as an adult) has a couple of friends.

"you 've got mail is a timely romance for this impersonal, computer- driven decade. 
 two people who 've never met confide in each other via e- mail without revealing their true identities. 
 nora ephron 's contemporary update of the shop around the corner retains the basic plot: two people who despise each other unwittingly become enamored with each other through their anonymous correspondence. 
 ephron, who co- wrote the film with her sister, delia, as well as directed it, knew what she was doing by reteaming tom hanks and meg ryan as the at- odds couple. 
 ryan is kathleen kelly, owner of a small children 's bookstore, while hanks is joe fox, who heads up a chain of mega bookstores( think barnes& noble). 
 their charm and chemistry are the glue that binds this film, even through some of the script 's rough spots. 
 for the ephrons invested so much effort in their protagonists that they give short shrift to the talented supporting cast, including parker posey, greg kinnear, jean stapleton and steve zahn. 
 yet no one is really going to complain because the ephrons know their audience- and what the paying public wants is hanks and ryan. 
 and the two are kept busy. 
 one, the other or both are in nearly every scene. 
 hanks has his decent guy routine down pat, yet each time he does it, 
 it seems effortless, spontaneous and fresh. 
 ryan 
 smoothly moves between spunky and vulnerable, with a sexy touch of winsomeness added to the brew. 
 their scenes together sparkle, even though they lack the nostalgic romanticism of sleepless in seattle. 
 and the shadow of that earlier hit hangs over you 've got mail like dried- up mistletoe.

"according to hollywood movies made in last few decades, life in small town is one of the worst things that could happen to a human being. 
 even worse fate awaits those who were unfortunate to grow up in those dark, god- forsaken places and later forced to live forever traumatised by the experience. 
 on the other hand, it seems that something more than atlantic ocean divides europe from america, because one of the most popular and beloved european films takes exactly the opposite view. 
 this film is amarcord, 1974 comedy by famous italian director federico fellini, which later gave inspiration to numerous imitations and homages, and even led few american screen artists to adopt its heretical views about benefits of small town life. 
 the film is based on the screenplay by fellini and tonino guerra and it lacks the plot in usual sense. 
 instead we follow one year in 1930s italian summer resort town of rimini through the series of short vignettes that depict various local events and customs, as well as series of local, often very colourful characters. 
 although many of those characters occasionally take the role of narrator, movie concentrates on its nominal protagonist, 14-year old boy titta( played by bruno zanin) and chronicles his sexual frustrations, obsession with local beauty queen named gradisca( played by magali noel), problems in his lovingly dysfunctional family, as well as troubles his father( played by armando brancia) have with mussolini 's fascist regime. 
 amarcord was often noted as the ultimate nostalgia film, and it probably explains why it is very popular, even among those people who actually do n't like federico fellini 's work very much. 
 every member of its potential audience would find part of himself or herself in this film, because fellini in this film clearly illustrates natural human desire to paint past in the best way possible. 
 distortion between actual past and its subjective interpretation could be found even in the title of the film- word"" amarcord"" is nothing more than badly pronounced phrase"" i remember"" in local italian dialect.

"notting hill 's trailer is awful: a laughless, schmaltzy montage. 
 the movie was desperately marketed to the anti- phantom menace crowd, the same lovelorn females who ignored the love letter. 
 and it apparently worked. 
 perhaps the presence of julia roberts- whose allure beyond those perfect teeth still escapes me- had a lot to do with notting hill 's opening weekend success, but the film 's staying power is based on word of mouth. allow me to spread some more good buzz for notting hill.

 a common thief, some spilled orange juice, and 
 some stilted conversation leads to their first, highly impetuous( or is that improbable?), kiss. 
 days later, william sneaks into her hotel suite under the guise of a magazine journalist, and so begins a passionate, albeit surreptitious, affair. 
( aside: notting hill 's portrayal of press junkets is deadly accurate.) 
 only anna 's celebrity- or william 's lack thereof- threatens to drive a wedge between them. 
 richard curtis has tapped into fantasy we all have considered, and for at least its first half- hour the picture 's"" beauty and the beast"" -like scenario is( romantic) escapism of the highest order. 
 as with groundhog day or pleasantville, while watching the high- concept comedy notting hill one constantly imagines him/ herself in the lead; it 's william 's ordinaryness that entices the spoiled and bored anna. 
 curtis( who previously penned four weddings and a funeral) is also smart enough to know that the unlikely couple 's situation is not enough to fuel two hours' worth of entertainment, so

"since their film debut in 1984 with the tightly wrought texas thriller"" blood simple,"" joel and ethan coen have been one of the most eclectic, original, and downright fascinating creative teams in modern hollywood. 
 their films are highly stylized, deeply embedded in a particular time and place, and their characters are more often than not everyday people who get caught up in highly unusual circumstances. 
 in"" the big lebowski,"" their first cinematic offering since the multiple academy award- winning"" fargo,"" the action takes place in los angeles during the gulf war, and the hero of the story is jeff lebowski, aka the dude. 
 the dude is played by jeff bridges -- 
 one of hollywood 's most underrated actors -- in the best stoned performance since sean penn stumbled through the halls of ridgemont high. 
 the dude is a simple man who has never quite made it out of the sixties. 
 he has shaggy, shoulder- length hair, a grizzled goatee badly in need of a trim, and he wears mostly stained tee- shirts, long shorts, and gellies without socks. 
 he smokes a lot of pot, drinks a lot of white russians, and is more than content to spend the majority of his time bowling with his two buddies, a slightly psychotic vietnam vet named walter sobchak( john goodman) and donny( steve buscemi), one of those guys who always wants to be part of the conversation, but never quite makes it in. 
 one day, the dude is confused with another jeff lebowski( david huddleston), this one being a millionaire philanthropist whose trophy wife, bunny( tara reid), owes a lot of people a lot of money. 
 the main plot and all its accompanying side- plots and coenesque diatribes are far too complicated to get into here.

"lean, mean, escapist thrillers are a tough product to come by. 
 most are unnecessarily complicated, and others have no sense of expediency -- the thrill- ride effect gets lost in the cumbersome plot. 
 perhaps the ultimate escapist thriller was the fugitive, which featured none of the flash- bang effects of today 's market but rather a bread- and- butter, textbook example of what a clever script and good direction is all about. 
 the latest tony scott movie, enemy of the state, does n't make it to that level. 
 it 's a true nineties product that runs like greased lightning through a maze of cell phones and laptop computers, without looking back. 
 although director scott has made missteps in the past, such as the lame thriller the fan, he 's generated a good deal of energy in pictures like crimson tide and top gun. 
 that vibrant spirit is present here, shown in well- timed and carefully planned chase scenes that give the movie an aura of sheer speed. 
 enemy of the state also features an unprecedented use of amazing cinematography -- director of photography daniel mindel throws a staggering amount of different views, angles, lenses, and film stocks at the audience that goes a long way toward involving the audience in the movie

 enemy is truly a visual experience, and that 's only one of the reasons

"1992 's alien3 marked not only the death( by suicide) of its popular protagonist, ellen ripley( sigourney weaver), but, in many ways, the alien franchise itself -- box office receipts were anemic, thanks to poor audience word of mouth; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments, 1979 's alien and 1986 's aliens, savaged david fincher 's slog of a sendoff( myself included). 
 hence, weaver, director jean- pierre jeunet, and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two- fold challenge -- not only somehow resurrect ripley, but also rescue this once- profitable series from the scrap heap. 
 despite the odds, they have succeeded, even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two. 
 writer joss whedon devises 
 a quick, easy, and painless answer to the dead ripley problem -- clone her, which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161, the prison planet of the third film. 
 that done, the_ real_ challenge presents itself -- what do with her. 
 alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful 
; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable, exploring her maternal side; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death. 
 what could be next? 
 whedon comes up with a clever spin: since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen, the blood used for the clone is also"" infected"" with alien dna. 
 so the new ripley is, indeed, new -- a human/ alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength, 
 a psychic bond with the deadly species, and a more predatory attitude. 
 unfortunately, that is where alien resurrection 's clever streak in writing stops.

"expectation rating: a bit worse than expected( mainly because i found the middle part to be a bit dull). 
 roger ebert gave it a four star review, and while he is a critic that uses the full scale, and i often agree -- such as dark city being the best film of 1998, he must have seen a better film. 
 i read the book about five years ago and hugely enjoyed it. 
 the opening of a simple plan reminded me a bit of the sweet hereafter. 
 the landscape is snowy and cold, and is filmed what i feel is in a rather crisp manner( which also reminds me of fargo( which i loathed)). 
 one can almost sense the cold. 
 but the movie far from the eye popping delights of the quick and the dead, instead raimi has made a more constrained film -- which probably is for the better. 
 this is probably not a movie that would have been improved by lots of odd shots. 
 the movie also reminded me of affliction, as the lead characters all seem to be hoping for and seeing a possibility to lead a better life than their father, and they see a chance for such a dream to come true.

"it is simply amazing 
 how"" the green mile"" developed in its three hour running time. 
 based on the stephen king series of the same title, the film starts out painfully slow, with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue. 
 however, as the plot begins to progress, the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction. 
 frank darabont, who masterfully followed a prisoner 's story in"" the shawshank redemption"", this time follows the perspective of a prison guard, paul edgecomb( tom hanks). 
 through edgecomb 's experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent, the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law. 
 from an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner,"" the green mile"" is successful in creating sympathy for kind- hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners. 
 the plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them. 
 the performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb. 
 the ensemble acting in the film is perfect. 
 hanks, david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles

 they are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles.

"the jekyll and hyde story told from his maid 's point of view is, in a word,"" dark"". 
 you would n't expect something bright and cheery based on robert louis stevenson 's novel, but the film is surprisingly dreary and dismal. 
 jekyll/ hyde( john malkovich) is terminally depressed and desperate. 
 mary reilly( julia roberts) is a victim of monstrous child abuse and the anti- woman sentiment of the times.

( except there 's no red, of course.) 
 the look is so moody and melodramatic that you 'll be shocked when you leave the theater. 
 i saw it at a matinee and took quite a while to adjust to the sunny skies afterward. 
 often the jekyll and hyde archetypes are viewed as splitting a whole person into components of good and evil or perhaps cerebral and emotional parts. 
 here the doctor is intellectual and perhaps good, but certainly powerless. 
 his alter ego is forceful and totally without conscience. 
 two parts that make up a whole. 
 neither are capable of functioning without the other and once separated, disaster is inevitable. 
 the differences between the two characters would be more effective if it were accomplished by demeanor and attitude. 
 when we finally see the transformation, the special effects thrust the story into the realm of science fiction, not the psychological horror that the tale demands.

 both are suitably melancholy, fitting in with the rest of the film.

"people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels, stories, comic books or movies. 
 often science fiction aficionados find material, previously labelled as science fiction, to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror, or rather simple techno- thriller. 
 in such cases, mistakes are understandable- genre boundaries are never clearly marked. 
 but, i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic. 
 such thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago, when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff, 1983 film directed by philip kaufman. 
 the mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits. 
 but the right stuff film is n't even fiction. 
 it was based on the non- fiction book by tom wolfe, covering the early years of american space program. 
 the plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base, major test site for experimental planes. 
 the major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier. 
 many pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado. 
 but one quiet pilot, chuck eager( played by sam shaped) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots, determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records. 
 ten years later, soviets have launched"" sputnik"" marking the beginning of the space age. 
 in order to regain national prestige, us government decides to be the first to send man into space. 
 best air force, navy and marine pilots are recruited into program, but not yeager, because he lacks college education and desired all- american image. 
 in one of critics' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s. 
 such high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman 's film looks",positive,"The reviewer appreciates ""The Right Stuff"" for its historical accuracy and its portrayal of the early years of the American space program. They find the film to be among the top films of the 1980s and they appreciate its realistic look.

 the x- files is the film that continues the story where the season finale left off. 
 the film is like a two- hour episode, except that there are a lot more special effects, the plot is thicker, and the resolution is more satisfying. 
 this is a terrific film, both for fans of the series and for those who have never seen it( i imagine that viewers unfamiliar with the show will find the film to be solid and riveting entertainment). 
 i expected to like it more than any episode i 've seen, and my expectations were met. 
 actually, the film takes a few risks in its story and plot devices, but, 
 thankfully, the makers managed to do it right. 
 when the finale ended, the fbi branch known as the x- files had been destroyed, and our heroes, mulder( david duchovny) and scully( gillian anderson) were left stripped of five years of hard work.

 farquaad agrees to relocate the pests, on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona( diaz) -- whom farquaad desires to we d -- from a far- off castle. 
 grudgingly, shrek sets out, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, donkey( murphy). 
 review: 
 one memorable aspect of disney 's"" aladdin"" was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents. 
"" shrek"" does the same for eddie murphy; ironically, though, murphy 's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass. 
 all the same,"" shrek"" does represent murphy 's best comic outing in years, and as donkey he steals all the best lines. 
 for instance, after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature, donkey soars into the air and scoffs,"" now i 'm a flying talking donkey!"" and despite its many contributors, the script for"" shrek"" is full of such comic gems. 
 myers is delightful in more of a straight man role, and lithgow also gets some great moments 
( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man). 
"" shrek"" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts, and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain 
. 
 things do go somewhat astray during the film 's middle segment, which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie 's greatest strength. 
 but even then, one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation, whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology.

 the two terms have been practically inseparable since ferris buehler took the day off in 1986. 
 now it is 13 years later, and broderick has another high school comedy, election, to show the world. 
 ferris buehler 's day off showed an educational setting that was similar to a pile of marshmallows.

"if he does n't watch out, mel gibson is in danger of being known as someone other than mad max. 
 of course there are still a few big guns in this film, but there 's some accomplished acting too. 
 although gibson continues to shed his rough and gritty anti- hero skin as his career progresses, here he explores a new genre: the businessman as action hero. 
 in ron howard 's latest film, gibson plays tom mullen, a gazillionaire airline owner whose son is snatched from the junior science fair by kidnappers. 
 mullen at first agrees to pay the ransom, but when things fall apart he rethinks the situation. 
 a veteran of numerous hard- nosed business negotiations, the tycoon realizes that in order to get his son back alive, he has to play his hand differently. 
 the casting is what puts this film over the top. 
 the trio of gibson, the kidnappers' mastermind( gary sinise) and fbi team leader( delroy lindo) play off of each other wonderfully. 
 sinise is perfect as the driven scheming sleezebag is right on the mark. 
 his speech to mullen over a walkie talkie about h. 
 g. 
 wells' morlocks and eloi reveal his vision of society. 
 mullen and the other glitteratti frolic up on high while sinise and the other lowlifes

"only a year after the initial release of"" scream,"" the horror send- up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre, the inevitable sequel"" scream 2"" has arrived in our theaters. 
 while the tongue- in- cheek, parodic element is still noticeable in this film, it 's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story. 
 the first film, while often violent and gruesome, was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant. 
 the premise of"" scream 2"" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called"" stab,"" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers( courtney cox) about the events in"" scream,"" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening. 
 i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy. 
 its conclusion, in which a bleeding, wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it 's a publicity stunt, is more surreal and disturbing than anything else. 
 the satire in"" scream 2"" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general. 
 although resident horror film geek randy( jamie kennedy) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels( and, interestingly enough, how they are usually inferior to their predecessors), the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well.

"with the release of gattaca, i began to wonder why all science fiction films deal with destructive aliens, or aliens in general. 
 hollywood has given audiences plenty of thrills with those alien films, but what was usually lacking was a good story... and good characters... and good acting, etc( contact being the exception). 
 and for some reason, hollywood has never taken a look at the aliens here on earth. 
 the closest, that i have seen anyway, was 2001: 
 a space odyssey, which made mankind an alien race themselves, being dwarfed by the technology which they created. 
 now comes gattaca, another film about technology reigning supreme, except here on our planet. 
 the difference between 2001 and this one is simple: gattaca is more frightening. 
 most of the concepts of this movie are based on recent discoveries in genetic engineering. using this premise, writer/ director andrew niccol creates some genuine suspense and thrills. 
 unfortunately, due to a lack of advertising, i fear gattaca may fair horribly at the box office. 
 since seeing the film, i have been asking people if they have seen gattaca. 
 lately, however, i have been asking them if they have even heard of gattaca. 
 most people do n't even realize that it is a film. 
 despite this fact, i surely hope that the audience members who have seen this film will tell their friends about it.

 susan macalaester genetically alters the shark dna and grows them twice the size with brains as big as humans, naturally producing more of the much treasured hormones. as sure as the sun sets in the west, a shark breaks lose and wreaks havoc within the facility during a hormone extraction procedure.

 sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin 's lair, he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness. by using semi- darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world.

 raul julia plays aram fingal, a drone data processing worker for novicorp whose active imagination and predilection for hacking gets him into trouble with authority. 
 caught watching"" casablanca"" on his desk monitor, fingal is sentenced to"" doppling"" rehabilitation -- he is to spend forty- eight hours in the body of a baboon. 
( how exactly this is supposed to rehabilitate him is anybody 's guess.) as it happens, thanks to a visiting schoolboy 's prank, his body is temporarily misplaced, and his mind has to be shunted into the central computer to keep him alive until they can find it. 
 as time ticks away before his memory cube self- destructs, the frantic search for his body is on... 
 while fingal first creates a virtual reality fantasy world, then finds there 's no better way to hack the system than from the inside. 
 during the chaos, computer technician apollonia james( linda griffiths) maintains contact with fingal through a datalink, manifesting several different times to offer advice or warnings.

"i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago, picking up the grand jury prize at the festival.' holocaust comedy receives standing ovation', the headlines read. 
 intrigued by this statement, i looked up information on the film and found that, sure enough, life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years. 
 even though the movie was extremely well- received by critics and public alike 
, i could n't help but be disgusted at this notion; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated. 
 only now do i see the error of my ways. 
 after finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time, it became clear that it is not, as the headlines proclaimed, a"" holocaust comedy""; on the contrary, life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps. 
 rather, it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son, who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation. 
 roberto benigni( who also wrote and directed the movie) stars as guido orefice, a chaplin- inspired clown and all round jolly guy who, as the film opens, is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher( nicoletta braschi, benigni real life spouse).

 as jerry and lori fall in love, can he do what must be done to fulfill his pledge? 
 review: at first,"" the pledge"" appears to be just another standard, if well- executed, crime drama. 
 it is anything but; in its final hour, it turns the corner and becomes a riveting, terrifying study of its lead character, jerry black. 
 penn pays attention to all the trappings of the serial killer genre, but they are just window dressing. 
 his interest here, unequivocally, is jerry, a man so haunted by his pledge that it consumes the entirety of the his existence. 
 at first, we see this only in small hints; some of his habits change, for instance, and he suddenly takes up smoking in a big way. 
 but then, when jerry buys the gas station and befriends lori, the true extent of his mania draws horrifyingly into focus. 
 nicholson is fantastic, portraying black with rare subtlety and animus; jerry 's gradual descent into obsession is like a car wreck, a thing horrible to look at but impossible to turn away from. 
 penn coaxes 
 good supporting performances from much of the rest of his cast, too. 
 only eckhart disappoints as jerry 's replacement, stan; he never seems entirely convincing, too much a tool of the plot.

 cartman, stan, kenny and kyle are very excited to see the new terrance and phillip( beavis and butthead types) movie"" asses of fire"". 
 but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets, they learn the movie is rated r, which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 can not get in without a parent or legal guardian.

"alien 3 is the only alien film i have seen in theaters. 
 i saw it when i was 13 years old, and i must admit that i did n't like it. 
 of course, i was expecting aliens again, and i believe this was my fault. 
 in order to appreciate alien 3, you need to see aliens, but you also have to wipe away all the expectations from its predecessor. 
 james cameron 's aliens was an action film, and many people consider it the best in the series. 
 i am among that group, but alien 3 is an extremely entertaining film, which critics have bashed for its originality. 
 many thought the final chase scene went on for too long, and many others thought that the film was too much dialogue and not enough action. 
 both are untrue, because the film has quite a bit of action, and the dialogue was essential and well- written. 
 as for the chase sequence, it was long, but not overly long, creating quite a bit of suspense from confusion. 
 perhaps watching alien 3 on video helped. 
 on the big screen, i was overwhelmed by something i normally did n't see. 
 it was a very dark film, and the language was extremely harsh. 
 i had always figured the alien series to rely on smart dialogue instead of moronic profanities. 
 do n't get me wrong -- i'm not saying films should eliminate swearing, but when a film substitutes dialogue with these profane remarks, it gets rather distracting. 
 however, since seeing it again, i realize that the swearing is mainly just an aspect of the restrained hatred in the characters. 
 as a result, alien 3 's only flaw( albeit a major one) is the underdeveloped characters. 
 we never really care about any of them, and i get the feeling that many scenes were cut in order to shorten the length of the movie.

"martin scorsese 's kundun, which chronicles roughly the first twenty years of the life of the currently exiled dalai lama, has been criticized for its lack of narrative structure. 
 personally, i do n't think it needs one: 
 it works perfectly well as a study of tibetan buddhist culture and how communist china. 
 scorsese views the dalai lama the way many tibetans probably do, as a larger- than- life symbol of buddhist spirituality and political leadership: the only glimpses into his head come from several interesting yet oblique dream sequences, but his portrayal is appropriate for a film that concentrates on the political and spiritual rather than the personal. 
 the set design and cinematography are outstanding, and while scorsese occasionally seems to get carried away with the spectacle, it helps to augment the cultural contrast when the dalai lama travels to china to meet chairman mao.

 does not: it succeeds in delivering its message in an artistically interesting way and without being overly manipulative.

"though 
 it is a fine piece of filmmaking 
, there 's something about elizabeth. 
.. 
 that left me a bit cold, and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films, particularly these days 
; i just did n't care about the characters. 
 to me, the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters( be they imagined or historical as the case may be) that the audience gives a hoot about. 
 and though elizabeth works well on many levels, it falls short of excellence because of that very reason. 
 elizabeth takes place in england in 1554, as queen mary, half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying. before she dies, though, she can not bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs. 
 as a result, amidst much anger within the council, elizabeth becomes the queen of england. 
 the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life. 
 much of the film deals with elizabeth 's love for lord robert, a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen. 
 there is much ado about her lack of a husband, and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation. 
 the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece, as love interests are such a character driven element.

 they are horror fans, they know how stuff happens in a horror movie, they know what to do and what not to do, and that makes it scary, and even funny at certain times. 
 you can tell this just by watching the opening scene where casey becker( drew barrymore) is making popcorn, getting ready to watch a video, and some guy who sounds like a killer calls her up to play a game with her that involves horror movie triva that, if she gets it wrong, will get her and her boyfriend killed. 
 she knows what to answer when he asks her horror film questions, she just ca n't answer his final question,"" what door am i at?"" and that gets her killed.

"to paraphrase a song title from an earlier disney movie, mulan is a whole new world. 
 the mouse factory 's latest feature is a treasure, featuring magnificent animation, a strong story and finely drawn characters. 
 mulan is the story of a fiesty, head- strong young woman who, unlike other disney heroines, is n't seeking her prince charming, mulan 's motivations are simple; to save her father, serve her country and find a place for herself in a world in which females have no say. 
 the story of mulan takes place in ancient china at a time when the huns have invaded the nation. 
 the emperor has called for a conscription, one man from each family to join the army and defend the nation. 
 mulan 's crippled father is called, but mulan sneaks off, steals his armor and takes his place. 
 mulan is a saga of courage and self- discovery. 
 yet, despite the grim backdrop of war, it is a lively tale of self- reliance and brain- over- brawn that even the smallest child can appreciate and enjoy. 
 the movie utilizes a strong corps of asian- american talent as the voices for the main characters, including the wonderful ming- na wen( the joy luck club) as mulan, 
 b. d. 
 wong as shang, mulan 's commanding officer and later love interest, pat morita as the emperor and the veteran soon- tek 
 oh as mulan 's proud, but loving father. 
 also adding to the proceedings is eddie murphy as mushu the dragon, sent by mulan 's ancestors to watch over and help the young woman. 
 his fast, wise- cracking, hip- talking mushu may seem out of place, but it 's a crowd pleasing performance, especially for the youngsters. 
 the movie features only a couple of songs, fewer than most previous disney animated flicks, but mulan 's are winners. 
 the music by matthew wilder and lyrics by david zippel fit nicely into the plot. 
 the overall score by jerry goldsmith 
 also is a plus",positive,"The review lauds the movie ""Mulan"" for its animation, story, and characters.

"as a revolutionary war hero in the patriot, mel gibson provides another macho man performance for hollywood audiences. 
 you know the type: his shirt is always shredded, his face always scarred, he has a soft spot for his loved ones and a"" to kill"" list for his enemies. 
 oscar- hungry director/ executive producer roland 
 emmerich did not intend to, but he made the stereotypical action hero for the 18th century. 
 as gibson delivers lines like,"" before this war is over, i am going to kill you,"" schwarzenegger in commando or stallone in cobra immediately come to mind. 
 oddly enough, the patriot is as much an epic three- hour- tear- fest like gladiator, as 
 it is a ninety- minute guilty pleasure. 
 at times absorbing, at others enjoyably insipid, this is good, bloody summer fun. 
 i probably would have despised this film had it not been released over the july 4th weekend. 
 some of the images are so zealously americanized( the flag is used as a lifesaving weapon for example), that independence day seems the only appropriate time of year to wholeheartedly accept it. 
 like emmerich 's id4, this is obvious propaganda where the americans are the hapless underdogs motivated by freedom for all. 
 sure it 's predictable and melodramatic, but for a moment after leaving the theater, i was dumbfounded with patriotism. 
 and is n't that the point of the patriot? 
 gibson plays benjamin martin, the lionized french and indian war veteran, who, at the beginning of the film, is emotionally suffering after his loving wife passed away. 
 he is left to father seven children at his south carolina estate along with black servants( not slaves!). as the revolutionary war rumbles miles away, martin swears to keep his family close and away from the battlefields.

 if there 's a beast in men, it meets its match in women, too. 
"" starring sarah patterson, angela lansbury, tusse silberg, david warner directed by neil jordan written by jordan and angela carter, from a story by carter cinematography by bryan loftus in recent years, there has been a trend in the field of fantasy: writers have been revisiting the fertile world of myth and fairy tale and reclaiming that world, investing it with new life and energy. 
 in modern times, fairy tales have become disneyfied and debased; they have become trite adventures involving leering witches, friendly dwarves, and cuddly talking animals. 
 but in their original forms, fairy tales have a dark, wicked edge. 
 crows tear out the eyes of cinderella 's sisters, a gorier fate then they receive in the animated version. 
 hansel and gretel relish cooking the witch in her own oven. 
 writers have become fascinated by the bloodier, morally ambivalent aspects of fairy tales, and are now modernizing the old stories while simultaneously going back to their roots. 
 before this trend was in vogue, angela carter -- whose stories always have a dark, wicked, subversive edge -- had been reinventing fairy tales for years. 
 in the company of wolves, she and neil jordan retell the story of red riding hood, enlivening it with werewolves, rolls royces, and a visit from satan. 
 the story is structured as a dream, occurring in the mind of rosaleen( sarah patterson), an adolescent girl about whose' real' life we learn very little. 
 within the dream, there are a number of inset stories, most told by dream- rosaleen 's grandmother( angela lansbury), and these tales gloss the central story in intriguing, suggestive ways. 
 the result is a surprisingly successful example of a sinister, contemporary fairy tale.

 and there are ways in which it does.

 while this is going on, danny and his old drunkard buddie, ike( ken stott, who played the chief inspector in danny boyle 's"" shallow grave""), re- open an old gym which allows the two opposing religios sects, protestant and catholics, to work together.

 little does england know that a young woman named elizabeth( cate blanchett) will be their greatest hope for survival.

 carrey stars as truman burbank, a capra- esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl( laura linney) in the south florida island town of seahaven, which looks like michael eisner 's idea of the perfect american small town. 
 truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle, complete with a working wife, a best bud, friendly neighbors and interesting co- workers. 
 there is tragedy in his past- his father drowned in a horrible boating accident, leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water, and of travel in general- 
 but overall, life is good.

"i did n't realize how apt the name of this movie was until i called the mpaa( the motion picture association of america- the folks who decide what 's g, nc 17, pg, r or x) to ask why the preview was rated r. 
 so that we can make some sense of their response, let me tell you about the movie itself. 
"" 
 the celluloid closet"" is a documentary about how homosexuality has been portrayed in the movies over the past several decades. 
 it 's brilliant, funny, naughty and extremely poignant. 
 it tore at my heart to watch a gifted lesbian screenwriter explain that, as a rule, gay audiences hunger for any hint of homosexuality on screen. 
 regardless of how veiled- or how sordid- the presence of a gay or lesbian person allows others to lessen their sense of isolation and makes them feel as if they 're not quite so invisible as america seems to want them to be. 
 the movie itself is rated r- and for good reason. 
 it contains scenes of bloody, violent gay bashing and graphic, uninhibited, sex. 
 as with any movie, i appreciate knowing about these things ahead of time, so i can decide for myself whether to see the movie with a friend, a date, my 11 year old niece, alone or not at all. 
 but, that 's the movie. 
 now back to the preview. 
 prior to this film being theatrically released( it was originally filmed as a documentary for hbo) i had seen the coming attractions trailer for it at least six times. 
 there was no nudity, no violence, no bad language, nothing that i could see that would be offensive or inappropriate for a general audience( okay, whoopi goldberg did refer to someone"" boning"" someone, but

 mamoru oshii is a name that probably is n't very well- known to most american audiences, but perhaps it should be. 
 oshii was the director of last year 's best- known japanese animated film import, 
_ ghost in the shell_, and is known among fans of japanese animation, or anime, for making films with a deep philosophical bent. 
 one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series. 
 in its many incarnations -- graphic novels("" manga""), two different runs of made- for- video episodes( original animation videos, or oavs for short), and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes -- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan. 
 set in the very near future( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived), this atypical giant robot anime features the characters, rather than the machinery, as the primary focus. 
 as a whole, patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan. 
 as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains, giant industrial robots, known as"" labors""( an interesting play on words, considering that"" robot"" is derived from the czech word for labor), have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century. 
 with the rise of labors, however, has come a new menace -- labor crime. 
 this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions, using patrol labors to fight labor crime. 
 the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division, sv2, who, through no fault of their own, have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness. 
 sometimes utterly hilarious, sometimes almost deadly serious, the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers, and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life.

"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking, go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers. 
 the story centres around a group of people, who include brit simon( askew), and checkout girls claire( holmes) and ronna( polley) and the misadventures that they get into, split into three chapters. 
 everything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers. 
 although qt 's touch is evident in nearly every frame, go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride. liman, who also photographed the film, 
 has a deft touch with the camera, and the film looks good. 
 the film also seems to have benefited from a budget, with the night- club scenes in particular looking pretty good. 
 there 's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk. 
 the young cast are talented and help bring the story to life. holmes, one of the dawson 's creek cast( a show i 'm not particularly fond of) displays much talent here, and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature. 
 askew is slightly successful, being rather obnoxious. 
 no doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him, but instead of' funny annoying' he 's just annoying. 
 he drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters, but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it. 
 the real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl: her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining.

 after a few disastrous"" mating"" attempts, he figures his best bet will be susan( annette bening), a former alcoholic who eventually tells harold that she wo n't have sex again until she gets married. 
 the leader of harold 's planet( ben kingsley) tells him to marry her, and harold is soon exposed to all the"" joys"" of married life. 
 despite its title and premise which seem to imply that this is some jerry lewis vehicle from the late 1960s, what planet are you from? is a very funny movie. 
 the plot( which the film wisely does n't linger on the specifics of for too long) is of course nothing more than framework for the jokes, most of which work very well

 the material may be considered crude and tasteless by many, and i might have thought so as well had shandling not been the lead.

 it was a period that would mercilessly force me to exit boyhood and thrust me into the unwelcome arms of adulthood.

"full metal jacket, very much like every other hard- hitting film about the vietnam war, is an shocking, emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america. 
 this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man( private joker, played by matthew modine) during his tour in the vietnam war. 
 however, full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before: boot camp. 
 these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film, even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning. 
 as in platoon, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start. 
 the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits, which is getting their heads shaved. 
 from there, they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman, played extremely well by the former drill instructor r. 
 lee ermey. 
 apparently, the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies, because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations. 
 private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant, as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence( vincent d'onofrio), whom is dubbed' gomer pyle' by sgt. hartman.

"oliver stone 's latest feature is the last one standing in the long line of biographies of american presidents. 
 it 's a three- hour long saga about the life of one of the most hated and misunderstood leaders of the 20th century. 
 stone does n't hold back anything as he digs deep inside politics and legal maneuvers of the white house. 
 the director holds nixon responsible for everything he has done. 
 at the same time he creates a very human character, a brilliant and tortured man that is caught in the dirty game of politics, which is here pictured as a wild animal. 
 he is simply trying to tame it. 
 but the occasional switch to the raging sky and the clouds swiftly fleeing over the white house as events run ahead of the president 's ability to control them. 
 stone does n't in any way apologize for nixon. 
 he blames not only nixon 's own character flaws but also the imperial presidency itself, the system that, once set in motion, behaves with a mindlessness of its own. 
"" nixon"" is a modern shakespeare story- a saga about a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws. 
 there 's something almost majestic about the process: 
 as nixon goes down in this film, there is no gloating, but a watery sigh, as of a great ship sinking.

"in tim burton 's` sleepy hollow', there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name. 
 he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe. 
 burton 's update on washington irving 's classic tale of` the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman, when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror. 
 writer andrew kevin walker(` seven') 
 throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes, but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing, as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine 
. 
 as` sleepy hollow' opens, we 're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau, who won an oscar in burton 's` ed wood'. 
 landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow, who, on a fateful carriage ride through the forest, is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider. 
 after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town, constable ichabod crane( johnny depp) is sent in to investigate. 
 landlord baltus von tassel( michael gambon) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case, and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods. 
 crane is not a man of great superstition, and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie).

 a romantic comedy about the trials and tribulations of single working parents? 
 with a couple of incredibly cute kids thrown in for good measure? 
 yuck. 
 but it 's not really too bad. 
 it has a lot working against it, for me at least. 
 in addition to the above, it is typical of a lot of recent movies in that it is really just a glorified made- for- tv movie, but longer and with bigger stars, and you have to pay to see it. 
 it does win you over, though, even if it is painfully predictable. 
 just think about it: 
 two single parents, with their cute kids, are thrown together due to a missed field trip. 
 through a day of near disasters, they cont inually meet, get in one another 's way, cause trouble for one another, and generally insult one another at every opportunity. 
 in fact, they hate each other so much that we know that they are, or soon will be, in love. 
 the only people who hate each other more than lovers are married couples. 
 so this film is predictable, just as the screwball comedies of the classical hollywood cinema were predictable( and the screwball genre is obviously hoffman 's model for this film).

"bowfinger is a good movie about the making of a very bad one. 
 the screenplay, written by co- star steve martin, skewers everything in hollywood from cheesy science- fiction movies to chop- socky fight sequences, and all in a crafty and accomplished manner. 
 anyone who knows of, or has had any association with movie- making should thoroughly enjoy this clever comedy for it 's entire duration. 
 the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one. 
 bobby bowfinger( martin), a cheapskate and small- time hollywood producer, has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so. 
 a new script, an alien invasion story entitled chubby rain, has caught bowfinger 's eye. 
 after confronting a big- name producer named jerry renfro( robert downey jr.)

 in all fairness, it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it. 
 as if reservoir dogs was n't perfect, tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction, a fast- paced, hard talking, roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way. 
 every major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor. to begin with, the two hit men: vincent vega( john travolta) and jules winnfield( samuel l. jackson).

 as the final scene closed out in happy slow- mo fashion,

 high +2( -4 to +4) in my opinion one of the best films of the last few years is istvan szabo 's sunshine, a film that covers the fortunes of a jewish hungarian family under the reigns of three different regimes, hungarian aristocrats, nazis, and communists. 
 szabo 's follow- up film, a german production, is much more limited in scope. 
 it is about the post- war investigation of who criminally supported the nazis and who opposed them. 
 ronald harwood 's screenplay ambiguously looks at the investigation of a great classical music conductor who stayed on in germany when the nazis took power and became the most popular conductor of the third reich. 
 maj. 
 steve arnold( played by harvey keitel) has been assigned by his superiors to investigate wilhelm furtwangler( stellan skarsgard), perhaps europe 's greatest classical music conductor. 
 when other artists fled germany, furtwangler remained behind and conducted for the hitler and his henchmen. 
 after the war is over arnold assigned to interview furtwangler and members of his orchestra and if appropriate to prosecute him for war crimes. 
 he secretly is told by his commanding officer to find furtwangler guilty. 
 from there we follow him and learn a little about arnold and something about furtwangler and his orchestra.

" gattaca"" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science- fiction films -- it 's a genre picture that does n't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story. 
 the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction. 
 this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color, intelligence and life span 
 they 'd like for their child, and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects. 
 those made the old- fashioned way are labeled as"" in- valids"" and confined to the lower rung of society. 
 vincent freeman( ethan hawke) is one such person, born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish- molded younger brother anton. 
 fed up with being second- rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space, vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation. 
 everyday, he watches as"" superior"" folk make his fantasy a reality. 
 determined to do the same, vincent meets a dna broker( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo) who sells fake identities to in- valids. 
 his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow( jude law), an ex- athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life. 
 for a price and the promise of a caretaker, jerome supplies vincent with his identity, as well as blood, skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on- the- job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card. 
 because of his drastically improved status, vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca, and catches the eye of comely co- worker irene( uma thurman) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect, she 's enamored by his flawless persona 
 she does n't know is a lie.

 i can, however, describe what we see on the screen: l. a. jazz saxophonist fred madison( bill pullman) and his wife renee( patricia arquette), whom he clearly suspects of infidelity, receive a series of videotapes apparently filmed inside their house while they were asleep. 
 they are, naturally enough, more than a little frightened and confused, and it does n't help matters any when"" mystery man""( robert blake) approaches fred at a party and proceeds to call himself on the telephone at the madisons' house in a scene that is at once hilarious and unnerving.

"" crash"" is structured to play like a porn flick, but with significantly more plot and dialogue. 
 while we see several extremely taboo scenes of weirdo sex, we also have a skimpy little plot going on( mostly towards the beginning), and maybe just a hair of characterization. 
 not to mention the acting is generally pretty good, and we do n't really see a lot of the actors completely exposed. 
 but what makes it supremely different from a porn is the fact that this is not an erotic experience. 
 this film does not posess the erotic hypnotism of"" henry and june"" or the just plain horniness of, say,"" deep throat""( not that i 've seen it).

 on my second viewing, i realized that the film follows the three act structure( i did n't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it). 
 the first act serves to set up the characters- sort of. 
 it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness, and perhaps even feelings of boredom.

 the majority of the film is one extended battle scene, intercut with brief flashbacks and voice- overs.

 the format of the show consists of nelson, servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched, and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love, the ship on which our heroes are marooned. 
 only two things are different in the movie: the absence of forrester 's sidekick, tv 's frank, and the slower pace of the jokes. 
 this latter change is presumably deliberate to avoid the viewing audience missing some of the best lines while laughing from the previous joke.

"the uncompromising nudity bared throughout petrice chereau 's intimacy has already garnered much notoriety, but it 's in the naked faces of fearless actors mark rylance( angels& insects) and kerry fox( welcome to sarajevo) that the tender ache of emotional resonance is discovered. 
 with sharp, intelligent eyes that reflect experience and maturity, rylance and fox are refreshingly detached from the false glamour of hollywood idols. 
 their sex scenes together are bracing in their raw honesty, in the acceptance of flesh and messiness. 
 less apparent, but no less remarkable, are the astute observations of behavior revealed through those carnal beats of haste and hesitance, often without a single line of dialogue. 
 not aiming for the spiritual poetry of in the realm of the senses or the philosophical transgressions of crash, chereau keeps his sexual odyssey firmly grounded in terms of straightforward character development. 
 that may be the very reason why intimacy seems unerringly impressive but never particularly significant on more than a tactile, sensory level. 
 the themes of human isolation are barren and obvious, a science project devoid of any especially groundbreaking hypothesis. 
 intimacy does manage to stand out from lesser portraits of"" human interconnectedness"" and pinter- esque rummages through psychological dirty drawers( okay, kill me).

" psycho meets the exorcist with no holds barred"". 
 a blurb like that sounds like desperate publicity for some low budget, third rate rip- off. 
 but no, this tacky plug comes from the poster for suspiria, perhaps italian horror director dario argento 's most consistently successful film. 
 what impresses most in re- watching this surrealistic, supernatural thriller is that argento 's directorial flair and stylish visuals are matched by a near- fully coherent narrative. 
 screenplays have always been his achilles heel; confusing subplots, gaping holes, totally illogical incidents and reactions. 
 no question: argento has always been a better director than a writer. 
 fortunately, he gets the plotting pretty well right with suspiria, taking his cue from a book by thomas de quincey called"" suspiria de profundis"". 
 the film 's storyline suffers from no major lapses in logic, provided one can accept the premise of a ballet school being a front for a coven of witches. 
 jessica harper plays an american who travels to germany to further her studies in dance. 
 arriving at the school late at night in driving rain, she sees a girl leave and run into the storm in a clearly distressed state. 
 what happens next- and i do n't make the comparison lightly- is a murder sequence that for intensity, shock value and sheer directorial flair ranks alongside alfred hitchcock 's infamous shower scene in psycho. 
 it 's quite possibly a homage to hitchcock, but with its baroque sets, graphic gore and brilliantly chaotic musical accompaniment by the gothic rock group goblin, this stunning sequence remains very much argento 's own. 
 though nothing else quite equals the intensity of suspiria 's opening 15 minutes, the film continues to be never anything less than engrossing as harper begins her own investigations and slowly comes to realise this is no ordinary ballet school.

 the setting is after the first world war, during the great depression years. 
 a nine- year- old orphan named little tree( joseph ashton) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa( james cromwell) and his native american grandma( tantoo cardinal) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee. 
 here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life-- and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise. 
 everything is miraculous to a child. 
 but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u. s. 
 government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma, and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school, a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress, pray, speak, and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment.

"disney cements their place in the forefront of feature animation with the release of their latest animated adventure, mulan. 
 while it adheres a bit too close to the disney formula to be perfect, it is nonetheless an entertaining film for both kids and adults. 
 fa mulan( 
 ming- na wen, singing: 
 lea salonga) 
 wants nothing more than to be a dutiful daughter and honor her family. 
.. 
 it 's just that she does n't quite fit in with the chafing customs of her time. 
 while most girls her age are trying to quietly and demurely seek the approval of the local matchmaker( miriam margoyles), mulan would prefer speaking her mind. 
 but there is trouble on the horizon. 
 the evil huns, led by shan- yu( miguel ferrer), are invading china. 
 the emperor( pat morita) has decreed that each family must donate one man to serve in the army. 
 the only male in mulan 's family is her father, fa zhou( soon- tek oh), who, old and with a bad leg, honorably accepts his fate. 
 mulan, on the other hand, decides to save her father 's life. 
.. by secretly masquerading as a man and taking his place on the battlefield. 
 mulan, under the assumed name of ping, appears at camp where she, along with the other bumbling recruits, yao( harvey fierstein), chien- po( jerry tondo) and ling( gedde watanabe), are trained in the art of war by captain shang( b. 
 d. 
 wong, singing: 
 donny osmond). 
 but she 's not alone in her tasks. 
.. 
 in typical disney fashion, she has three animal companions: her horse khan, a lucky cricket crickey, and a pint- sized"" guardian"" dragon called mushu( eddie murphy).

"the rich man 's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double, where the story and characters are so one- dimensional and contrived that you know you should n't be enjoying yourself. 
 but somehow, the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things. 
 not that it 's bad, it 's just that it 's been done before; and better, in my opinion. 
 i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre, but it 's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet, striving helplessly to get out, and instead of just flushing him,

"with a team of 200 graphic artists and animators working on this first film production from game developer squaresoft 's square pictures, final fantasy, inspired by the top- selling game franchise, is visually awe- inspiring and groundbreaking. 
 no doubt, you have never seen anything like this film, and the hyperbolic fanfare surrounding its release is absolutely deserved. 
 but why does such a tremendous feat of eye candy have to be weighted down with a problematic story, wooden dialogue and generally uncharismatic voice acting? 
 obviously, the primary goal of the film is to stun and amaze audiences with extremely sophisticated cgi. 
 everything you see in the film is rendered in great detail 
: individual threads in the fabric, individual strands of hair swaying, wrinkles and pimples on skin, incredible water effects. 
 overall, the expressions and lip movements fairly accurately match the emotions and dialogue; and the times when they do n't sync perfectly really stand out, since the animation is usually so dazzling.

 it 's title: starship troopers. 
 and surprisingly, it is more entertaining than id4. 
 i realize that i gave last year 's 
 sci- fi hit a 4 star rating, but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour. 
 after subsequent viewings, i feel that independence day really was n't as great as it seemed -- though i still give it a positive review. 
 starship troopers, on the other hand, has a mocking sense of humor, knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem. as a result, starship troopers is a more exciting, energetic, and lively science fiction film. 
 in fact, i probably could never get tired of watching this film. 
 starship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars, another kick- ass space opera which reinvented the sci- fi drama altogether. 
 while starship troopers is no star wars, it comes quite close, and the easiest assessment would be to call this film:"" the' star wars' of the 90s.

"billed as a"" feminist sex fantasy"", this spirited, imaginative and thoroughly engaging film by the award- winning canadian director cynthia roberts, is destined for extreme reactions. 
 camille paglia enthusiasts will no doubt champion this heart- felt tale of the title character bubbles galore( nina hartley), a porn- actress- turned- porn- producer who faces an uphill battle in her quest for sexual and economic independence. 
 however, those in the andrea dworkin camp, will no doubt loathe the film 's decidedly pro- porn stance. 
 political considerations aside, however, this is a delightful lesbian love story as the film takes us on a whirlwind tour of bubbles' romantic entanglements with a naive and virginal young porn starlet dory drawers( shauny sexton). 
 in the backdrop, however is bubbles' loyal assistant vivian klitorsky( tracy wright) who pines longingly for the affections of her bubbly boss. 
 this femme- butch- femme triangle is what provides the film with considerable humanity* and* sensuality. 
 in addition to the romantic aspects of the story, bubbles is being stalked and terrorized by her ex- boyfriend godfrey montana( daniel macivor), a slimy porn mogul who wishes to make her life as miserable as he can possibly make it.

 maybe it is better to ignore it, as this strong and biting satire, as only juzo itami can deliver, will give you an insight as to what some foods go through. having, in the past, made films that pulled every punch imaginable, from the family traditions( the funeral), to taxes( a taxing woman& a taxing woman returns), to the diabolical gangsters( minbo), to hospitals( the seriously ill), juzo itami, this time takes on the supermarkets' own war, to get the consumers. and while this film has its funny side, in the crazy situations that it creates, it also shows another side, which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer.

"i can sum up first strike in one word: awesome. 
 never in my life have i seen an actor as insanely dedicated as jackie chan. 
 for the simple reason that he has performed his own stunts in his every movie he 's ever appeared in, he should be awarded greatly. 
 the same tom and jerry formula that was used to make chan 's rumble in the bronx and supercop so entertaining can be found here as well. 
 however, first strike was probably the most exciting out of the three, for the simple reason that practice makes perfect. 
 his last two movies were almost like practice and this one was great. 
 like rumble, this film is about the mafia, the former kgb. 
 now chan must do battle in the freezing arctic temperatures of the ukraine against a group of very large bad men. 
 the trailer for the film sums it up quite well. 
 first strike is action- packed, but the fight scenes are so fast and furious, they almost have a witty, italian- like humor to them. 
 jackie chan is a regular comedian. 
 well, he 's no eddie murphy, but he can really crack you up. 
 for example, he is hanging off a roof and he humorously taunts his foes to come and get him, as he claims to be the korean 007 
( that 's secret agent james bond). 
 even the plot to this film improved above the others, as a sort- of twisted nuclear- weapon smuggling deal is botched and jackie takes the blame.

"as a devout atheist and an avowed believer in aliens, i have some idea of how ellie aroway 
( jodie foster) feels. 
 but because my reasons for not partaking in religion are different than hers, i ca n't say that i do exactly. 
 her reason is that she needs solid proof: there is no proof that god existed, so therefor she does not believe. 
 ellie also believes in aliens, and has spent most of her life trying to prove they exist.

 that 's the premise for deceiver, a new thriller from the pate brothers, jonas and josh, who made their mark on the film world two years ago at sundance with the movie the grave.

 drawn by the clever artwork on the video box, i rented the film expecting a complete turkey. 
 mute witness, however, was original, offbeat, and well- made. 
 it 's 
 one of those cool little finds that no one seems to know about. 
 i 've subsequently found it at most video rental places i visit, and it may be seen, on occasion, on the independent film channel. 
 the first hour of mute witness is extremely tense, as billy, the quite believable mute heroine, sees members of the russian mob brutally kill a prostitute while filming an illegal snuff film. 
 the rest of the film takes good advantage of billy 's vulnerable position as a mute foreigner in moscow being pursued by powerful criminal figures. 
 to throw a curveball into the fray, billy 's sister karen and her filmmaking beau become bizarre figures of comic relief to offset several violent sequences in what are some genuinely funny scenes. 
 a disappointingly trite ending and occasional comic blunders are the only two things which mar this otherwise suspenseful film. 
 look for alec guinness( obi- wan kenobi from the first star wars trilogy) in a small role as the evil reaper.

 the project which turned out to be his last full- length feature film. 
 alongside the appalling zombie schlock of hacks like lucio fulci, beyond the door ii is simply a revelation. in his day bava was considered by most to be no great filmmaker, yet here he fashioned one of the finest italian horror movies of the 1970 's. 
( note that the film has no connection with the 1975 exorcist- rip off behind the door, but for some unexplained reason was given this related title for release in the usa and australia.) 
 this story focuses on dora, a women set upon by a malevolent spirit that channels itself through her young son marco. 
 the film opens with dora, her son and second husband bruno returning to a house by the sea that was the scene of her first husband 's suicide and her subsequent trauma 7 years earlier. 
 they hope to put the past behind them, but as small accidents start to befall dora- usually while bruno is away on business- she starts to suspect that marco( played with uncanny ability by 8 year old david colin jr.) is somehow involved in the strange goings on. 
 to reveal any more of the story would be unfair. 
 suffice to say that this artfully paced study of a woman suffering a nervous breakdown offers an intriguing plot, loads of atmosphere and solid acting, though the dialogue is somewhat weakened by the dubbing into english. 
 bava coaches a surprisingly good performance from the usually wooden daria nicolodi, wife of famed italian horror director dario argento.

 his latest challenge is his biggest though... 
 he must stop the vampire deacon frost( played by stephen dorff) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires.

 i can count the number of good comic book based movies( not including japanese manga) one hand: 1: the crow( 1994), 2: batman( 1989), 3: superman, 4: the mask, and now,# 5, blade. 
("" men in black"" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book) why is this? 
 for the most part, it is because the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match. 
 the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere, which the director provided. 
 the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics, which the casting and cg effects reflect. 
 superman is not over the top with colour and flash, and the film reflects this. 
 blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film, creating an appropriate atmosphere.

 washington plays carter, a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late- night shooting in a bar. 
 jailed for 20 years, he maintained that he had never committed the crimes, but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals.

 i 'm guessing steve has a thing for nazis; i really would n't be surprised if a velociraptor ate one of the swastika- wearing dudes in the next jurassic park movie.

, sci- fi/ horror that is event horizon. 
( more is on the way with contact and alien: ressurection being released later this year.) 
 the story is thus: in 2040 an explorer ship called the event horizon tests out a newly invented gravity drive. 
 a device that enables a craft to travel anywhere in the universe, instantaneously. 
 this is achieved by creating a gateway, infact, a black hole, between the craft 
 and it 's required destination. 
 in this case, from near neptune to proxima prime. 
 however, when the event horizon attempts this, it dissappears, without trace, leaving two searches for it fruitless. 
 seven years later, it reappears, transmitting a distress signal and 
 this is where the film starts. 
 a search and rescue ship is sent out to investigate. 
 the team is led by laurence fishburne, and joining them is sam neill who plays the scientist that invented the gravity drive. 
 as the team search the event horizon, they find no trace of the crew but plenty of blood lying around. 
 not a good sign.

 to make matters worse, as they search the ship, they find themselves being subjected to a series of illusions based on their own individual inner secrets and worse, some very bloody events start to occur as they slowly piece together the events that transpired on the ship seven years ago.

 oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles. 
 the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states. 
 many of these cubans had criminal records, such as tony montana, a cocky, fast- talking man who has the look of crime. 
 nearly right after his arrival in miami, tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry. 
 along with his friend and partner, manolo( steven bauer), tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez( robert loggia), a high- roller in the organized crime field. 
 tony also begins to fall in love with elvira( michelle pfeiffer), who at the time was frank 's lover. 
 of course, sooner or later in this industry, betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else, and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force.

"trekkies, roger nygard 's energetic and hilarious documentary, brings viewers into the world of the star trek conventions. 
 the beauty of the film is that it is good old fashion fun for trekkies and non- fans alike. 
( the film generally writes off the trekkies vs. 
 trekker polemic as not worth arguing about.) 
 the good- spirited movie trekkies easily forces even the most cynical viewer into fits of uncontrollable, loud giggles, yet the picture treats its subject matter with respect and a certain awe. 
 denise crosby, who played tasha yar on"" star trek: the next generation,"" serves as the host. 
 in the opening credits the movie reminds us that trekkies are the only fan group listed in the oxford english dictionary( oed).

"if you 're the type of person who goes on the submarine ride every time you visit disneyland, you 're going to love the hunt for red october. 
 you 'll also love the film if you enjoy cat and mouse military tactics, or if you 're a sean connery or alec baldwin fan, or if you admired director john mctiernan 's earlier films, die hard and predator. 
 in fact, the only people likely to be disappointed with the hunt for red october are those who have read the book, since films almost never live up to the novels which inspired them. 
 the hunt for red october is an epic thriller, adapted from tom clancy 's best selling novel. 
 set in an era before glasnost, the movie revolves around a top- secret soviet submarine, called the red october. 
 the nuclear sub has a revolutionary propulsion system, which makes the vessel silent and allows it to escape sonar detection. 
 the red october embarks on its maiden voyage under the command of captain marko ramius, played by sean connery. 
 ramius has strict orders just to test the submarine, but he has other ideas. 
 he takes the sub and its crew and disappears into the atlantic ocean. 
 is he planning to start world war 
 iii? 
 cia analyst jack ryan does n't think so; he 's convinced that ramius plans to defect to the u. s. 
 ryan, played by alec baldwin, is given three days to prove his theory and find the missing sub. 
 the characters in the hunt for red october are paper thin, but the performances, thankfully, are rock solid.

"i was pleasantly surprised by this film. 
 with a budget topping$ 200 million, i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century 's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see. 
 how much could you dress up the sets? 
 how many models and computer effects could you use? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks? 
 oh, if i 've just given away part of the plot for you, go back to school. 
 after having viewed titanic, however, i found it to be a well- paced, well- designed, and overall well- made movie. 
 there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic, but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i 've seen. 
 titanic tells its story in two time periods. 
 it starts out in the present, when ocean explorer brock lovett( bill paxton) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic, searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship. 
 what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace, which is broadcast on the news. 
 the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett, who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas. 
 there she tells her story to lovett and his team. 
 in 1912, rose dewitt bukater( kate winslett), a young lady belonging to society 's upper class, boards the titanic for the ship 's first atlantic crossing, from southampton, england to new york. 
 she is engaged to cal hockley( billy zane), an heir to old money, and a snob in every sense of the word.

"it 's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast. 
 sure, there have been delightful outings like last years hercules. 
 but nothing entirely groundbreaking. 
 with the release of the studio 's newest feature length film, a remake of edgar rice burrough 's creation tarzan, disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques. 
 it 's no classic, but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be 
. 
 the plot is loyal to the original storyline, as tarzan 's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in the jungles of africa. 
 but, they are killed( offscreen) by the snarling cheetah sabor, leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib. 
 found by kala( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close), a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack, tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own. 
 we follow the young boy through the years, as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell) and clumsy elephant tantor( wayne knight). 
 of course, in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero. in tarzan, these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously. 
 gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here. 
 most of the characters are amusing without being forced. 
 as tarzan grows to manhood, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture. 
 here, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton( brian blessed), who 's accompanying a hapless professor( nigel hawthorne) on an expedition through the jungle. 
 of course, there 's the professor 's daughter, jane( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie. 
 the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation",positive,The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the maturity and animation techniques used in the movie.

 while i do n't blow any plot details, the more you know about a movie, the more disappointing and built up it becomes( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing). 
 but, in a nutshell, it 's a good film. 
 star wars episode i: 
 the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world( i was more into star trek: the next generation), it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment, the phantom menace. 
 however, it ca n't be ignored. 
 endless toys lining the shelves, endless news reports, and a multi- billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult. 
 with the level of this hype, one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998, godzilla, which definitely failed to live up to expectations. 
 thankfully, the phantom menace does much, much better. 
 while the"" first"" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker, the prequels backpedal to tell the back- story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader). 
 without blowing too much of the story, the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo, which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation, and it 's up to two jedi knights( qui- gon ji, played by liam neeson and obi- wan kenobi, played by ewan mcgreggor) to free it. 
 the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics, leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat. 
 common complaints range from lack of characterization, weak narrative, poor direction of actors, the dated style, and too much focus over special effects. 
 still, film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism, much of which the average film buff does not care for. hence, this film",positive,The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film for doing much better than other overhyped films.

 and if you can find a colorful action film, even if it is from six decades ago, then there is a real possibility of a take home hit. 
 so it was in our family when we wandered over to the classic section of our local video store the other day and picked up a copy of the adventures of robin hood, a high spirited version of the walter scott story. 
 nominated for the 1938 academy award for best picture and winner of three oscars for erich wolfgang korngold 's melodramatic music, ralph dawson 's 
 fast paced editing and carl jules weyl 's lush sets 
, the film is probably best remembered for errol flynn 's charismatic acting as sir robin of locksley, a. 
 k. 
 a. robin hood. 
 flynn, with his handsome figure and toothy smile, charms the audience while clearly having a high old time himself. 
 let me cut to the chase and say that the tape was indeed popular in the rhodes household. 
 the littlest rhodes, jeffrey, age 8, liked it so much that he viewed it at least three times and maybe more. 
 i 'll let him discuss his fascination with the picture in his usual section at the end of the review. 
 simply stated, the film derives its success from being one of the best of its genre, the swashbuckler. 
 robin, with a smile from ear- to- ear, fights off a hundred men without a scratch. 
 although the picture can be considered as little more than a 1930 's james bond, 
 the production values and the acting raise it above that level 
. 
 robin hood is a classic story of rich and poor. 
 robin steals from the rich and gives to the poor as every schoolchild knows. 
 in this movie, however, he seems much less interested",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film for being one of the best of its genre, the swashbuckler.

 steven spielberg may not have directed( he only executive produced) but his touch certainly is evident in this movie. 
 and he knows a money making winner when he sees one. 
 the mask of zorro has the hallmarks of a blockbuster: big action, funny comedy, and the pacing of a rollercoaster. 
 hopkins plays 
 don diego de la vega, otherwise known as zorro. 
 a fighter for the people, he is eventually captured by don rafael montero( stuart wilson), who also, unintentionally, kills his wife. 
 the film cuts to twenty years later, where vega still wants to montero dead. 
 however, he 's far too old now, and trains up thief alejandro murrieta( banderas) to become the new zorro. 
 banderas motive? 
 to avenge the death of his brother, who was killed at the hands of captain love( matthew letscher) who rather tastefully keeps the head in a jar, in one of the more graphic scenes in this family movie. 
 with the scene set, the movie goes on full blast, with sword fights a- plenty and witty one liners. 
 banderas and hopkins have a marvellous chemistry as the two zorro 's, playing each other off with ease. 
 hopkins seems to come off a little better, but banderas does some excellent work. 
 as the bad guys, wilson and letscher seem one dimensional, but they go through the bad guy shtick in an above average way

 the audience does hate them, which ca n't be bad.

" rebel without a cause"" is such an important film in american history because it is a true analysis of youth in america that everyone of all ages can relate to. 
 everyone feels that they are different in some way, that they do n't belong in some places and"" rebel without a cause"" successfully shows on screen these universal emotions. 
 no matter what generation you belong to, these feelings are present. 
 this is why james dean is admired by america, because in this film he represents us all and his actions are actions that we would also execute. 
 in our minds, we just try to do the right thing just like dean 's jim stark does. 
 not only does"" rebel without a cause"" display these universal emotions for all to relate to 
 but it also shows that america has suffered a uniqe pattern in its social structure. 
 each generation looks at its past generation without a strong connection. 
 this is because times change and in response people change. 
 no matter how popular you were once, as your generation grows older, newer breeds look at you in a different light. 
 this is why stark and his friends never could form a strong relationship with their parents. 
 even if their parents insisted that they were also rebellious and troublesome in the past, the teens could not believe this. 
 in one humorous scene, stark, his girlfriend judy( natalie wood), and his pal plato( sal mineo) pretend they are adults. 
 they use upper class british accents and in their conversations they make it out to appear that kids are no good and should be ignored. 
 this scene shows that what was once cool in a past generation is the complete opposite in another. 
 speaking on behalf of my generation, i feel that dean has lost a lot of his coolness from our perspective as the years have grown by. 
 the only ones who seem to still lionize him are those members of his generation. 
 same goes for 
 brando, redford, even deniro. 
 i can only imagine how",positive,"The review appreciates ""Rebel Without a Cause"" for its relatable depiction of youth in America.

"david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director. 
 with his distinctive, more often than not ingenious dialogue, and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible. 
 some of them tend to be thickly layered, deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message, or sometimes even a concealed storyline. 
 and although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors, it is still a brilliantly complex, consistently riveting motion picture about honor, about sacrifice, and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right. 
 oh, and it 's rated g. 
 incidentally, this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else 's work; namely a play by terrence rattigan, set in the 19th century. 
 he casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow, a rich, aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note. 
""

 he asks his boy.

 they enlist the help of sir robert morton, a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task. 
 it all seems fairly frivolous, and no matter how you look at it, the winslow case is not the trial of the century. 
 but arthur is determined to keep his family 's word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that.

"catherine deane( jennifer lopez) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up. 
 she has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma, but the boy 's parents are n't happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life. 
 as if trying to assure the boy 's parents was n't hard enough on her, a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane 's mental faculties. 
 a vicious serial killer named carl stargher( vincent d'onofrio) has been kidnapping women, locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days, then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life- sized dolls. 
 just after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell, stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia. 
 the police, led by fbi agent peter novak( vince vaughn) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim 's body, but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state. 
 in a last ditch attempt, they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher 's mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell... 
 a cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours!

"when casting the key part of the voice of moses, most people 's first candidate would probably not be the controversial actor val kilmer( the saint and the island of dr. 
 moreau), but he was dreamworks 's choice in their first traditionally animated movie, the prince of egypt. 
 the selection of kilmer proved to be a wise one, but the biggest risk dreamworks took was n't in the casting department. 
 the radical departure was that they decided to use the medium of animation to make a biblical epic, a la cecil b. 
 demille, to move our hearts and minds rather than to tickle our funny bones. 
 in the press kit producer penney cox says that they wanted to make a film for adults based on sophisticated themes but one that did not exclude children. 
 animated movies for adults that are appropriate for kids and that are not comedies, now 
 that is something fresh 
. 
 let me admit up- front that i was quite skeptical as to whether dreamworks could pull it off. 
 dreamworks 's antz seemed to be a movie not quite appropriate for any age group. 
 the prince of egypt may be harder to market than antz, but it is much more satisfying. 
 like antz and unlike the more modest casting of pixar 's a bug 's life, the prince of egpyt has half of hollywood doing the voices. 
 danny glover is the voice of jethro, jeff goldblum of aaron, steve martin of hotep, helen mirren of the queen, michelle pfeiffer of tzipporah, martin short of huy and patrick stewart of seti. 
 you can figure out for yourself who does the voice of god. 
 the movie, which is weakest in the story department, is a cliff 's notes version of demille 's the ten commandments. 
 the script by kelly asbury and lorna cook has an obsession with touching briefly on every classic event in moses 's life.

 kenneth branagh 's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein- films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world, including the most controversial version of them all- directed by james whale. 
 the dark and stormy nights, the lightning bolts, the charnel houses of spare body parts, the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful. 
 but the center of the film, quieter and more thoughtful, contains the real story. 
 horror- fans will probably be disappointed by the total lack of horror. 
 branagh has instead concentrated on serious issues: morality, philosophy and human elements of the story, and not on old fashioned horror cliches. 
 his version is much closer to the book than all the previous adaptions of the classic novel. 
 the film begins and ends somewhere in the arctic ocean. 
 the year is 1794. 
 a bold captain is steering his ship through the unknown waters. 
 his gole is to reach the north pole at all costs. 
 as the ice closes around his ship, a figure appears on the horizon.

" love is the devil"" is a challenging film, munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot, perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist 's psyche rather than the artist 's lifeline. watching it, 
 i was enthralled with the look of the film, the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre, personalized filter. 
 everything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon, the film 's subject, looked at it personally. 
 but while 
 i was engrossed 
, i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film, awakened from my trance by some inner distraction, and began to try and follow what 's going on. 
 exactly what was i looking at? 
 watching this film, i was n't sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous. 
 directed( and written) by john maybury,"" love is the devil"" is stylish masterpiece for the senses. 
 everything looks originally bizarre and perplexing. 
 the camera angles are ferociously askew, and the close- ups are uncomfortably too close. 
 the editing is deft, occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds, but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs, or rather, intruders to bacon 's world and psyche. 
 as such, there is no real story. 
 i 've not heard much about francis bacon that i did n't read prior to the film, but what i learned was this: he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s, drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like. 
 he was one of the first to really come out of the closet, and in interviews, he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty.

"jay and silent bob strike back can rightfully be subtitled 
"" kevin smith 's greatest hits"" for the film is comprised of numerous references and characters from smith 's earlier works including, clerks, mall rats. 
 chasing amy and dogma. 
 so, be advised: bone up on that cinematic quartet in order to achieve the maximum enjoyment from smith 's latest outing. 
 kevin smith must be a very likable person because several good sports took a ton of kidding in this feature, most notably miramax, the studio whose subsidiary, dimension films, is jay and silent bob 's distributor. 
 others deserving accolades include ben affleck, matt damon, directors gus van zant and wes craven and the mighty george lucas. 
 this is a laugh- filled, foul- mouthed road film with jay( jason mewes) and silent bob( smith) hitching to hollywood to sabotage miramax 's production of bluntman and chronic, comic book characters based on the two jersey slackers. 
 jay 's convoluted reasoning is that if the film is shut down, people on the internet will stop insulting him and bob, even though it is not him and bob the people are dissing, but rather their comic book counterparts. 
 no matter, the duo begin their long trek hitching rides across the country. 
 but first they get some tips from a veteran hitchhiker, played by george carlin, who tells them to follow"" the book""- the rules of the road. 
 of course jay 's interpretation immediately gets the duo in trouble with a friendly nun( carrie fisher) who offers them a ride. 
 jay and silent bob contains enough laughs that the movie 's weaker aspects- which include a lame subplot about a girl gang of diamond thieves as well as a buffoonish federal park ranger played by will ferrell- can be easily tolerated.

 the story is about martians attacking earth.

 nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion, and also taking advice from his loopy officials. 
 but, basically, its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth. 
 the way people are killed by the ray guns is great, they is a hillarous( and mildly disturbing scene) involving a martian lady, a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away,( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding.

 action, drama and even some humour occur as the troop journeys through wartime france to find him. 
 after the disappointing amistad( 1997) spielberg has returned to form with this excellent movie. 
 i 'm not the war movie genre biggest fan, but 
 i found this film to be gripping, and very scary, thanks to the excellent cast, direction and terrifying battle scenes. 
 tom hanks is superb, straying away from his usually soppy dramatic roles, such as in forrest gump( 1994). 
 this time, he plays the role with gritty realism, and is much better for it. 
 occasionally he overacts the sentimentally, but he generally delivers a fine performance. 
 edward burns, looking a lot like armageddon 's ben affleck, also delivers a top notch performance, moving away from his roles in films such as she 's the one( 1996) tom sizemore makes less of an impact, but is still watchable, and matt damon reinforcing his position as one of the finest young actors working today. 
 spielberg directs very well, putting the audience right in the heart of the action of the battle scenes. 
 and what battle scenes they are! 
 they 're truly terrifying, yet the audience can not drag their eyes away from the screen 
. 
 the battle scenes are filmed with a jerky hand- held camera, and the panic and confusion felt by the soldiers is emphasized by this technique.

 the aliens have sent a large mother ship( supposedly to be 1/4 size of the moon) to attack earth by deploying attack ships 15 miles in radius to all the major cities on earth.

 granted, the plot is n't the most elaborate of tales( alien bad, find alien, kill alien), but i can honestly say that i was never once bored during the viewing of this entire picture. 
 i would n't recommend it to those who do n't like car chases, murders, and bland acting, but for all the rest of you out there, those who enjoy putting away their brains every now and again, sitting back, slamming back some salsa'd nachos, and relishing in the cheeze some call film..

 i still think that it does n't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute 's list of the 100 greatest american movies.

 a bataillon of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai.

 nicholson forces the japanese commandant, col. 
 saito( sessue hayakawa), to give way in this respect. 
 afterwards col. 
 nicholson assiduously commits himself for the building of the bridge.

"of the major horror sub- genres, vampire movies are easily the most adaptable. 
 think about it. 
 frankenstein movies have n't changed all that much because they still need that mad- scientist- in- bavarian- castle setting. if you made a frankenstein movie today, you 'd have to have the monster be a virus or something -- and outside of michael j. 
 fox, there are n't any actors that could play a virus convincingly.

 j. 
 fox thing again.) 
 but you can have vampires do anything, and you can place them in any genre you want, just about. 
 you can have traditional vampire movies( bram stoker 's dracula) or have the anne rice version( interview with the vampire), or play it for laughs( vampire in brooklyn). 
 you can put vampires in locales from sunny southern california( the lost boys) to squalid mexican dives( from dusk till dawn) to your local high school( buffy, the vampire slayer). 
 were it not redundant, you could have a movie about a law firm full of vampires. 
 any day now, i expect we 'll see a movie about a vampire third baseman who has to decide whether to play a day game in order to break the home run record. 
 or, you can insert the vampire legend into a hong kong action movie -- and when you do that, you get blade. 
 wesley snipes has the chow yun fat role in this movie -- the silent, expressionless hit man who destroys everything in his path.

 it somehow still works for me.

 the film takes place in harrisburg, pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter. 
 john travolta plays the local big- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards.

"this summer, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham 's series, a time to kill, was made into a major motion picture. 
 on january 3 of this year, director rob reiner basically re- released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi. 
 based on the true story of 1963 civil rights leader medgar evars' assassination, ghosts of mississippi revolves around the 25-year legal battle faced by myrlie evars( whoopi goldberg, sister act) and her quest to have her husband 's obvious assassin and racist byron 
 de la beckwith( james woods, casino) jailed. 
 so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter( alec baldwin, heaven 's prisoners) to imprison the former kkk member. 
 ghosts sets its tone with an opening montage of images from african- american history, from slave- ship miseries to life in the racist south of the 1960 's. 
 but all too soon, the white folks take over, intoning lines like"" what 's america got to do with anything?

 underneath the to- die- for cinematography, the brilliant acting, and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty, not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it, tell it in a certain original way. 
 it does n't merely go from plot point to plot point. 
 it goes from character to character. 
 it obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all, and makes the story of a world- reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters, both musicians, who have a totally unique relationship. 
 it 's that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball, shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this, unlike"" patch adams,"" effortlessly emotional and real. 
 in short, this movie is just awesome. 
 it merely tells its story really well, and that 's something that just has to be commended these days, when most stories are botched because they 're not told by great storytellers. 
 director anand tucker tells this story well. 
 he overdramaticizes everything, but still keeps it real.

( rachel griffiths and emily watson, respectively), two sisters who are first seen in childhood( played by auriol evans and keely flanders, respectively) as the very best of friends.

"as i write the review for the new hanks/ ryan romantic comedy you 've got mail, i am acutely aware that i am typing it on a computer and sending it a billion miles away on the internet. 
 i am also aware that i have just spent the last 2 hours watching the world 's biggest paid commercial for america online. 
 and i wonder: is that so bad? 
 well, the commercial part is. 
 as for the movie, well, as long as i can watch tom hanks and meg ryan, i think i 'll be okay. 
 to paraphrase james berardinelli, whose reviews i admire very much, tom hanks and meg ryan can act. 
 they are both wonderful, but for all of hanks' glorious work in serious films, such as his magnificent performance in saving private ryan, and his glorious triumph in philadelphia, i like him best when he 's suitably obnoxious. 
 tom hanks is wonderful 
 when he is obnoxious in a romantic comedy when he 's going to get the girl: the only question is how? 
 meg ryan, america 's high school sweetheart, can act. 
 she 's had a handful of memorable performances, including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally( i must not mention what she does, due to the, well, um, you get the idea, and if you do n't, get the movie-- fantastic). 
 but, i like her best when she 's, well, perky. 
 she is so adorably perky/ cute that together with hanks, they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime. 
 some people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples, but i do n't really know. 
 all i know is that i just like them both. 
 they have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that 's really hard to resist, and i 'm not going to even try. 
 they 're just really, really cute, sweet, and charming.

"are we victims of fate in life or can we create our own destiny? 
 director/ writer brad anderson seems to be saying yes to both questions in his witty film 
"" 
 next stop wonderland"". 
 the two main characters, alan and erin, spend the entire movie in each other 's orbit, catching glimpses of one another, yet not quite connecting until the inevitable conclusion. 
 is it fate that keeps them near each other and ultimately puts them together? 
 does this predestination carry over to all aspects of life? 
 as the film starts, erin castleton( hope davis), a melancholy 29- year old late shift nurse, is ending her live- in relationship with her boyfriend( hoffman). 
 rather, he is ending it with her. arriving home from work, erin finds her boyfriend parked in front of their apartment, car packed with his belongings. 
 in a fumbling, amusing and self deluding ramble, he instructs erin to watch a videotape he 's made detailing why their relationship is doomed to fail and why he 's leaving. 
 it 's obvious he lacks the courage to confront her directly as he rails on about accomplishing something with his life and taking a stand, all the while backpedaling his way out of their relationship. 
 he then flees the scene with the grace of an inept thief. 
 erin 's mother( holland taylor, in a surprisingly effective, small role), fearing that her daughter will be without a man in her life, takes out a personal ad for erin. 
 to erin 's embarrassed horror, the ad describes her as a"" frisky, cultured, carefree professional with a zest for life"". 
 eventually, erin responds to the tidal wave of responses, which makes for some of the most humorous, telling moments of the movie as she meets prospective suitors and"" poseurs"".

"i 'm an avid fan of the"" alien"" saga, so this review is obviously a tad biased( at least i admitted it). 
 of course, that does n't mean that i 'm gon na be giving this a four- star review or something, because"" alien: resurrection,"" the fourth film in the cool- as- hell series is not an absolutely amazing film, much like the first two were. however, 
 it 's a very good film which never fails to entertain, and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series. 
 in short, i had a good time. 
"" alien: resurrection"" leaves off 200 years after the last one, where our heroine protagonist, ellen ripley( sigourney weaver), the science fiction genre 's answer to job, had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body, waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one. 
 of course, the last one was n't very great or anything 
( i liked it, though not as much as the first two), and more importantly, it was n't financially successful( a tawdry 55 million bucks!) 
. 
 so back we are, with ripley back as a clone, which means we get another little satirical look at cloning( not that that 's a bad thing, but it 's becoming a cliche). 
 so she 's cloned aboard an even more futuristic- looking ship called"" the auriga"" by some doctors( including the necessary bad government guy, dr. 
 wren, played by j. 
 e. freeman, as well as the little- seen dr. 
 gediman, played by none other than brad douriff), mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her. 
 once you get past the fact that you ca n't figure out where they got her blood( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one), 
 the film 's okay.

"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship, a green ovular pin, and the birth of oscar wilde, but if one really strains, they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off. 
 wilde 's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature, and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned, loosing his family and his career. 
 the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise. 
 the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality), they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else. 
 and that 's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began. 
 it 's been said that todd haynes'"" velvet goldmine,"" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement, not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it, steals a lot from"" citizen kane,"" and that 's true. 
 in the film, a british journalist in the 80s, arthur stuart( christian bale), is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade, a fictitious rock star, who faked his own death on stage, bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement. 
 structure- wise 
, this totally steals from"" kane,"" not only from the set- up( he interviews three people, and the story is a result of their flashbacks), but in other things, like the beginning( death, then newsreel), and smaller details, like the bitter ex- friend in a wheelchair and the bitter ex- wife as a washed- up lounge singer, found in a bar after hours. 
 this is no"" kane,"" and it really does n't aspire to be: it",positive,"The review is positive because it appreciates the unique beginning of the film, the philosophy it portrays, and the way it chronicles the glam rock movement.

"when i first heard that romeo& juliet had been"" updated"" i shuddered. 
 i thought that yet another of shakespeare 's classics had been destroyed. 
 fortunately, i was wrong. 
 baz luhrman has directed an"" in your face"", and visually stunning piece with this film. 
 it revolves around the two rival families, who in this version each run multi- million dollar enterprises. 
 these rival companies/ families are the capulet 's and the montague 's. 
 the younger generation of these two families have formed gangs, who despise one another. 
 as the storylines goes, romeo montague( played by leonardo dicaprio) and juliet capulet( claire danes) meet at a fancy dress party, and it is love at first site. 
 i never believed love at first site was possible until i saw this film, 
 the scene in which romeo 's eyes meet juliet 's through the fish tank 
 is one of the most memorable. 
 of course, they can not publicly reveal their love, for their families are arch enemies. 
 so they marry in secret

"krippendorf 's tribe is a formula comedy. 
 done poorly, formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema. 
 however, every now and then, one emerges, like krippendorf 's tribe, that actually works. 
 professor james krippendorf( richard dreyfuss), the renowned anthropologist, is in trouble. 
 his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea. 
 however, he found. 
.. 
 nothing. 
 his wife has recently died, and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids: shelly( natasha lyonne), mickey( gregory smith) and edmund( carl michael lidner). 
 tonight, he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe. 
 rather than break the news( and face the consequences of misusing his funds), he invents a tribe: the shelmikedmu( named after his kids). 
 however, one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu, but his research becomes a popular phenomenon. 
 soon, professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members. 
 his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over- eager colleague, veronica micelli( jenna elfman), and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist, ruth allen( lily tomlin). 
 krippendorf 's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief. 
 no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras, or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes. 
 luckily, as the film builds momentum, that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by. 
 though there 's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe, the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies. 
 the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable, and the comic timing required for some of the film 's latter scenes",positive,"The review is positive because it appreciates the comedy in the film, the performances of the actors, and the humor in the plot.

"not since 1996 's shine, which starred geoffrey rush as pianist david helfgott, has a movie so defiantly laid bare the lives of world- class musicians. 
 in fact, if one were to watch these films together, it would almost certainly stand as a convincing argument that a life of music naturally leads to all varieties of social ills. 
 yet hilary and jackie, the sophomore effort from director anand tucker, has something more to say -- it softly but strongly explores the complex relationships of sibling rivalry and love in a very compelling tale. 
 emily watson and rachel griffiths are the leads in this tale, playing the sisters du pr?. 
 both musicians from childhood, hilary( griffiths) is renowned flutist while jacqueline( watson) is easily as skilled on the cello. 
 the two comepete for and win many honors as children and as young women, both together and seperate. 
 their careers as musicians surpass and then bow to one another 's, and although their lives take very different paths -- hilary settles down to marriage and a family while rachel skips across the globe on a world concert tour -- they are bound together by their deep family love. 
 the performances of watson and griffiths are excellent in style and substance. 
 they contrast each other wonderfully, and 
 while watson 's portrayal of jackie du pr? is at times eccentric and perhaps unsympathetic, both characters are charged with emotion. 
 the frank cottrell boyce script, which is based on the book by hilary and piers 
 du pr? 
, brings a great deal of depth to these characters as well. 
 the script is also to be commended for its well- polished dual nature. 
 cottrell boyce adopts a style which one might expect to see in a mystery thriller( which was in fact the case with david koepp and robert towne 's script for mission: impossible) and skillfully molds it to the story of two rising musicians on different courses to fame.

"the happy bastard 's 30-second review notting hill a cute romantic comedy from the writer of the hit comedy four weddings and a funeral, notting hill stars julia roberts as anna scott, a very popular actress with a$ 15 million asking price for movies. 
 one day she wanders into a travel book store owned by a simple london resident( played by hugh grant), and sparks somehow begin to fly.

 the first one, myself included, liked movies that featured spectacular car chases, lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions.

"nosferatu the vampyre( germany 1979) 
 a film review by mike watson copyright 1999 
 mike watson 
 this extraordinary re- telling of bram stoker 's"" dracula"" by german filmmaker werner herzog deserves the most prominent of places in cinematic vampire lore. 
 inspired by f. 
 w. 
 murnau 's 1922 silent film of the same name 
, herzog 's film is a work of exquisite bleakness, an oddly touching tragedy with a beautiful and uniquely haunting quality that lingers long afterwards. 
 the original full- length english and german language versions of nosferatu have at last received a video release by u. s. 
 distributor anchor bay entertainment, and in gorgeous widescreen prints. 
 until now only a shortened english language version of the film was available on video, and only in europe. 
 both of these re- releases restore the film to its full length, but viewers should still be wary of the english version due to its often stilted dialogue. 
 apparently the english dialogue coach herzog had on the set during filming was incompetent, and some of the voices also seem to be dubbed. 
 the german version with english subtitles remains the definitive one. 
 everyone knows the story of dracula. 
 or do they? 
 his story has been so bastardised on film over the years that a brief reminder of the basic plot certainly wo n't hurt. 
 jonathan harker is a young lawyer sent to the gloomy castle dracula in transylvania to do business with a creepy count( played by klaus kinski) who wants to buy a house in harker 's hometown.

"even if i did not know that director and co- writers

 helped create the hit television show the x- files, i would have inevitably made a connection. 
 the similarities are very apparent from the inexplicable phenomenon- like plot, to the mysterious characters, to the overall dark, ominous settings. 
 it would have been perfectly fitting to see fbi agents mulder and scully investigate this case, they witness stuff like this on a weekly basis( in fact mulder and scully would have been a much more welcome change to the bland one dimensional fbi agents seen in this movie). 
 another more important similarity, is that both succeed in entertaining and thrilling at the same time. 
 this is a great accomplishment for a teen horror movie, especially when compared to some of the trash, of the same genre, released in the last couple of years( urban legend and i still know what you did last summer are classic examples from the bunch). 
 what helps final destination is its unique premise. 
 unlike your average horror flick in which some invincible psycho with a knife chases blonde cheerleaders, the villain presented is unusual, it 's the grim reaper. 
 this being already has predestined when and how you will die. 
 according to the brief history lesson given in this film, everyone was meant to die at a certain time, some people at 100, others at 17, whatever death chooses. 
 what is unique about death is that it 's already dead, so you ca n't really kill it.

 within a couple of months, she loses her position as a head waiter, when her restaurant is bought out by a chain and the entire staff replaced.

 it would pass as deadpan humour if it was n't spoken with such resigned weariness. 
 this sets the tone for the rest of the movie. 
 there is humour and idiosyncracy at the periphery, but at the centre there is frustration and futility, and sorrow for the ways in which the logic of profit reduces people, until their worth is equated solely with their earning capacity. 
 there is an element of political commentary in this critique of the mechanisms of capitalism and the stultifying social environment it creates, but in drifting clouds the political is subsumed by the personal: the movie is about two people and what happens to them, and nothing else matters.

 sliding doors is a love' what if' story. 
 the gimmick is that it 's really two stories: the film follows the life of helen( gwyneth paltrow) down two directions.

 1) if she enters through the sliding door of a london subway train her life takes one path with one future 2) if she stays on the platform her life takes another path with a different future. 
 the film shows what happens in both paths, switching back and forth between intertwined, parallel stories. 
 in story one, helen meets a charming and talkative monty python fan named james( john hannah) on the train. 
 arriving home early, she discovers that her live- in, gerry( john lynch), is having sex with his former lover lydia( jeanne tripplehorn).

 running time: 90 mins. 
 this film is not rated. 
 the central themes of"" sick: the life and death of bob flanagan, supermasochist"" are pain and love, and its subsequent effect on a person 's life. 
 its protagonist, bob flanagan, who died at the age of 52, suffered from cystic fibrosis, a mortal disease which debilitates the lungs by saturating them with thick coats of mucus, preventing him from normal breathing. 
 the movie is about much more than recouperating( or attempting to) from this disease. 
 an audacious, fabulously triumphant docudrama,"" sick"" chronicles the life of flanagan and his vicious, unthinkable acts of sadomasochism conducted with his mistress of 15 years, sheree rose, who amazingly provided much of the footage for the film. 
 flanagan 's idelogy crosses the realms of rebelliousness and becomes transcendental, similar to terry zwigoff 's brilliant 1994"" crumb"", which also explored the dysfunction of an artist by painting not a sympathetic portrait, but a realistic one. 
 both crumb and flanagan revelled in their defects. 
 but flanagan was not only a man content on enduring the pain via lungs, he inflicted acts of pain on himself at a very young age, courageously defying god( he was an irish catholic) and turning his body into a work of art, which he unraveled in museums and lectures. 
 behold these works of physical art. 
 among them is a metal ball inserted inside his anus, and, --the most disturbing scene of the decade--, nailing his penis to a board. 
 flanagan was a man of great intelligence, wit and humor, as well as adopting a sense of candidness scarcely seen in modern filmmaking.

"studio expectations must not have been high for"" great expectations"" -- the film 's release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute, therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999. 
 it 's actually a smart move, because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale is n't quite oscar fodder, it* is* strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year. 
"" great expectations"" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right, especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann 's"" william shakespeare 's romeo+ juliet. 
"""" great expectations"" opens somewhere in 1970s florida( the original story is set in 19th- century england), as eight- year- old finn( jeremy james kissner) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future. 
 there 's icy, 11-year- old estella( raquel beaudene), a pseudo- playmate of finn 's; ms. 
 dinsmoor( anne bancroft), estella 's auntie who 's quite off- kilter over a past romance that never took off; and a mysterious prisoner( robert de niro) whom finn saves the life of. 
 finn, who lives with his sister 's affable boyfriend( lone star 's chris cooper), fancies himself an aspiring artist, and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms.

 opening sequences almost always make or break action films. 
 when done properly, not only are they actually exciting, but they foreshadow things to come. 
 this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie, but with a sense of the self- aware, enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in. 
 first there 's a high- tech, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly, chinese waters. 
 there 's definite tension as there seems to be an unknown, but certainly hostile, third party involved who is manipulating both sides. 
 when the scene ends in tragedy, it 's clear there 's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on, and who else to call on for such a case but james bond? 
 the film uses good judgment 
 in the way it introduces us to bond( brosnon). 
 as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious, bond is clearly( and obviously) depicted as an out- and- out hero.

"james jones, one of the major novelists from the middle of the twentieth century, has written a number of fictional works about the effects of war on the individual. 
 a veteran of world war ii, and a witness to the pearl harbor bombings, his novels are not only grounded in realism but poetic in nature. 
 they are reminiscent of stephen crane in their blunt eloquence, a trait which lends itself to razor- sharp focus. 
 but perhaps none matches the scope of his autobiographical novel, the thin red line; now a cinematic masterpiece from director terrence malick. 
 the book 's principal cast, some thirty characters, has been trimmed down for this rendition, but it still retains its most endearing value. 
 each of the roles has an everyman quality, emphasizing jones' examination of world war ii on the american soldier. 
 there 's a definitive chain of command present, and this also plays on the motivations of the cast. 
 but most importantly, and perhaps intrinsic to the novel but not to the movie, a dynamic and effective voice- over is used. 
 malick has several characters relating their thoughts, giving the viewer a greater perspective of the issues at stake. 
 the issues at stake are many and one. 
 told from a limited third- person perspective( as opposed to a top- down, omniscient view), the movie entails the struggle of an american infantry company("" c- for- charlie"") to take a hill during the conflict at guadalcanal. 
 the south pacific island is seen by the top brass as the key position for american armed forces to hold if they want to win the war. and want to win the war they do.

"an energetic, visually stunning, but intellectually hollow recreation of the mysterious life of jeanne d'arc. 
 in history jeanne d'arc is lost in an ocean of mystery and controversy, which creates the perfect launching pad for talented and creative directors, who can basically alter the story as they wish. 
 she came in a time where people desperately needed a saint. 
 a hero that could rescue them for misery and deliver peace and happiness. 
 director/ writer luc besson(' nikita',' leon') portrays his version of the peasant girl who commanded the armies of france and was burned at the stake for witchcraft. 
 besson tries to recreate the person behind the legend.

 he shows her as a human being. 
 in a time where blood was almost pouring from the sky, and the air smelled of rotten flesh, it is hard to keep your sanity. 
 the only support and hope is in god. 
 at the age of 13, jeanne( milla jovovich) watches her own sister murdered and raped by the english soldiers.

"i 'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks!, which is obviously the work of a deranged genius. 
 when tim burton 's twisted alien invasion comedy really works, it 's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure.

 is brilliant. 
 mars attacks! 
 is based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s, and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer 's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks, disaster movies, and big- budget special effects extravaganzas. 
 but unlike independence day, which was a painfully middle- of- the- road appeal to the hearts, minds and wallets of america, mars attacks! 
 has a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it.

 portrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are. 
 the title sequence is just splendid -- 
 an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation.

"i am starting to write this review before going to see strawberry and chocolate, cuba 's oscar nominee for best foreign film, directed by tomas gutierrez alea( who also directed the sometimes and in some circles critically acclaimed memorias del subdesarrollo--"" memories of underdevelopment"". 
 i saw memorias as part of a cuban cinema class back in the late' 70s; it merged the politics of the cuban revolution with mundane elements of the human condition. 
 i knew then that memorias was probably a state- sanctioned political missive, and now expect strawberry will follow suit. 
 fellow internetters, primarily in the newsgroup dedicated to cuba( soc. culture. 
 cuba), have mentioned that strawberry is a harsh criticism of the revolution and its current state of affairs. 
 i have jumped to the conclusion that strawberry is nothing more than a veiled attempt at espousing the party line -- it probably looks like political criticism, but it ai n't so. 
 having some first hand and extensive anecdotal knowledge of castro 's repressiveness, i ca n't conceive of his tolerating honest and adversarial criticism of the revolution, and i ca n't imagine his letting anyone even suggest his failure as a leader of a failed movement. 
 as kids say these days, duh!, the revolution 's current state needs no criticism; its physical and spiritual crumbling is self evident. 
 the proper questions to put relate to castro 's legitimacy. 
 i bet the film takes castro 's power for granted, and that this or any other movie, produced under cuba 's state control, can not question his right to run cuba 's political show( ongoing now for more than 36 years). 
 that 's why i just ca n't believe strawberry is an honest criticism of the regime. 
 let 's see what happens after the room goes dark and the screen lights up.

 i was right; castro remained intact.

"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity. 
 the film was directed by randal kleiser, who brought us such bubble- gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon. 
 but thanks to kleiser 's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script, getting it right is a pleasantly quiet, moving, and memorable film -- one geared strictly toward a sophisticated, adult audience. 
 getting it right 
 stars jesse birdsall( emily lloyd 's boyfriend in wish you were here) as gavin, a painfully shy 31-year- old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who -- gasp -- is still a virgin. 
 gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon, but expose him to a single 30-year- old beauty 
 and he 's a mess. 
 much to gavin 's surprise, the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan( lynn redgrave), a rich, married, and lonely 45-year- old. 
 getting it right is the simple story of gavin 's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right; that is, to find the right woman to fulfill his life. 
 getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in- depth character development. 
 gavin 's self- conscious voice- over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche. 
 we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self- confident maturity. 
 birdsall 's superb, understated performance 
 as gavin is the real backbone of the film; he seems convincing and authentic throughout. 
 the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin 's life.

" dangerous beauty"" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583. 
 it is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and certainly nothing short of entertaining 
, 
 but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness. 
 dealing with themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, subordination of women, sexual freedom, and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high- cultured society, it still feels like brightly lit fluff. 
 the director, marshall herskovitz, does n't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down, so he opts for a more genial, livelier, and relatively shallow interpretation. 
 the film takes place during the renaissance, a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe. 
 at this time, venice was its own republic, and it thrived on being the central juncture of east- west commerce. 
 the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice, so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived. 
 however, there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes, their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment. 
 the story centers on veronica franco( catherine mccormack), a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier( rufus sewell), the son of wealthy aristocratic parents( jeroen krabb? and joanna cassidy). 
 unfortunately, the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather, it was more like a business transaction, where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power, wealth, and ensure that outsiders could n't get in. 
 veronica, despite her charm and good looks, is certainly an outsider.

 it is not an easy situation, but a perfectly plausible one, the panorama in which breakdown musters it 's throbbing suspense and skillfully executed tautness. 
 it is not easy to cobble a distinct and gripping thriller nowadays, but breakdown does n't bungle into rudimentary plot holes or cliches and

 jeff can not detect the car 's problem, so he allows amy to take a ride with red

 made on a shoestring budget of$ 1. 2 million, with then relatively unknown actors, it is a provocative, thoroughly original drama. 
 the film mostly focuses on the four central characters, all in their late 20's- early 30 's. 
 ann( andie macdowell), an unfulfilled housewife, is married to john( peter gallagher), an insensitive lawyer, who, unbeknownst to her, is having an affair with her younger sister, cynthia( laura san giacomo). 
 complicating matters even worse is graham( james spader, who won best actor at cannes), john 's old college buddy, who comes to stay at their house. 
 ann is absolutely won over by him, even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex. 
 that is the set- up for the last hour of the picture, and since the film is entitled,"" sex, lies, and videotape,"" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise.

"synopsis: private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband. 
 after uncovering the authenticity of the film, welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers.

 though it does n't present a snuff film( a movie which documents a person 's murder for real, usually during or after some form of sexual act) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as, say, natural born killers, 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it. 
 it is not fun to watch; see something else if you get upset by realistic, sadistic violence. 
 this film 's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory. 
 for those with strong stomachs, however, 8 mm is an intelligent, worthwhile thriller, especially during its second hour. 
 nicolas cage, after a couple ho- hum movies, returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities. 
 as tom welles, a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly- born daughter, cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants. 
 serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix, who plays a struggling songwriter named max california. 
 california, despite his name, is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character, and phoenix 
 does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character.

` 8 mm' was a disappointing lost cause. 
 but who better than scorsese to match cage 's wit and intensity, which he does in miraculous fashion with` bringing out the dead'. 
 cage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce, a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day- to- day.

"harmless, silly and fun comedy about dim- witted wrestling fans gordie and sean( david arquette and scott caan) who idolize current world championship wrestling heavyweight champion jimmy king( oliver platt). 
 when king is screwed out of his title by a corrupt promoter( joe pantoliano), gordie and sean take it upon themselves to find their fallen hero and restore his glory. 
 my biggest fear about ready to rumble was dispatched early on, as the filmmakers are quick to show that wresting is indeed choreographed( but not fake, mind you). 
 the hook of the movie is that gordie and sean are just too stupid to realize that. 
 arquette and caan are suitably over the top with their performances, which is exactly what a movie like this requires, and oliver platt( one of my favorite actors) is a riot as the drunken washed- up ex- champion. 
 many have scoffed at the idea that platt should be playing a heavyweight champion wrestler with an unbeaten record, but for me it just added to the"" silly factor"" of the film, thereby increasing my enjoyment of it. 
 one casting complaint however: rose mcgowan as a sexy dancer? 
 please... if rose mcgowan is sexy then i 'm marilyn manson.

"steven spielberg is now considered as one of the hollywood deities, because of the rare capability to deliver both huge commercial hits, like jurassic park, and"" oscar"" -awarded 
 critical triumphs like schindler 's list. 
 however, in the 1970s spielberg built his reputation by creating works of art that could slip in both categories. 
 one of them is close encounters of the third kind, extremely popular and influential science- fiction spectacle. 
 unfortunately, it had a bad luck to be released in the same year as star wars. 
 although both films have a lot in common( ground- breaking special effects, brilliant score by john williams) their future was different; one became an unstoppable cult phenomenon, and another almost forgotten and stuck forever in its shadow. 
 when spielberg began work on that project, he was already established as a bright new hollywood star due to his previous commercial hit, jaws. 
 together with other young directors of his"" new hollywood"" generation, like kauffman, carpenter, hill and millius, he exploited the great creative freedom of 1970s, when even the mainstream producers dared to experiment. 
 ironically, it was spielberg himself whose later commercial success would established new unwritten rules of"" blockubuster"" philosophy. 
 but in the mid 1970s, many things were different; spielberg was young and eager to use hollywood resources for his very personal and artistic movie. 
 although very personal, spielberg 's screenplay was partly based on the book"" ufo experience"" by dr. 
 j. allen hynek and in many ways inspired by the popular urban mythology of extraterrestrial visitors to earth that began to grow in the world after ww2. 
 spielberg was not only inspired by the mythology, but his movie also gave the mythology itself a huge boost, unmatched until the contemporary era of x- files and the roswell anniversary. 
 that was partly because 
 he made the movie very realistic using the authentic ufo- related incidents as the element of the plot.

"with the exception of their surrealistic satire barton fink, the films of joel and ethan coen fit into two broad categories: quirky and sometimes darkly humorous takes on the"" film noir"" genre in which crime schemes go wrong and spin increasingly out of control( fargo, miller 's crossing, blood simple), and off- the- wall comedies centered around an eccentric, scatter- brained lead character( raising arizona, the hudsucker proxy). 
 their latest offering, the big lebowski, falls within the latter category, though there are elements of the crime- gone- wrong theme and even a touch of satire to be found in this film. 
 the main difference, however, is that while the protagonists of raising arizona and the hudsucker proxy had lofty aspirations and ideals but did n't quite have the brains to get it all together, the main character of the big lebowski seems like a fairly intelligent guy who 's wise to the world, but he does n't really want to do much of anything besides go bowling, smoke pot, and generally relax.

 the endurance: shackleton 's legendary antarctic expedition"" in 1914, as the great war descended upon europe, sir ernest shackleton began his third expedition to antarctica, this time to be the first to cross the ice- bound continent on foot. 
 28 men set sail on the brigantine endurance and they would not be heard from again for nearly two years. 
 director george butler, using film footage and photographs from the historic journey, tells their remarkable story in"" the endurance: shackleton 's legendary antarctic expedition. 
"" 
 the expedition started out as a merely incredibly difficult quest to traverse, on foot, the vast wasteland of antarctica. 
 as the intrepid ship and crew entered the weddell sea, the entry to the cold, cruel continent, they did not plan on the dense pack ice bringing the voyage to an abrupt halt as the endurance became trapped within sight of land. 
 for months the ice thickened and compressed until the ship was crushed, stranding the men on the flow, propelling them away from their goal and, eventually, into their lifeboats for safety. 
 shackleton, faced with a desolate situation, made the decision to lead the three tiny boats to the relative safety of uninhabited elephant island. 
 once on this"" safe"" haven, shackleton next turned his sights to saving his crew and returning them to civilization. 
 he and five of his men leave the island in an open boat to make the 800 mile journey on the world 's roughest sea to get help from the nearest inhabited island of south georgia. 
 miraculously, the six land, after 17 days at sea, on the uninhabited side of the target island and are forced to trek across treacherous, snow covered mountains, covering 22 miles in just 36 hours. 
 this ordeal is followed by several attempts by shackleton to get back to elephant island to rescue the remaining crewmen.

 this film floored me, for the simple reason that while it has a fairy tale concept, the rest of the film takes itself seriously enough, and presents itself well enough, to make it more of an american folk tale, with characters who are both icons and real people at the same time. 
 america has always had its mythical heros, its paul bunyans and john waynes; this film presents us with more general, but still universal, ideals: the honest, innocent children who have their own inner wisdom; the athletes who seem to be amalgamations of courage, honor, and love for their respective sport; the venerable elected official who leads with kindness and understanding, but has the grit to get things done when they need doin'( does the latter sound familiar?). 
 amazing grace and chuck is a showcase for these characters, but it never leaves you with the feeling that it 's artificial, that it stands behind glass, or that any sharp breeze -- or, more importantly, sharp thought -- will shatter the wax facade of the panorama.

"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy, we see a close- up of a blank movie screen at a drive- in. 
 we hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves. 
 without an image projected onto the screen, the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind 's eye. 
 even without having seen a cowboys and indians movie, somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema. 
 but do cowboys really exist, or 
 are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper? 
 exploring this theme, director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream, an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept. 
 is the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend? 
 midnight cowboy suggests that the american dream, like image of the cowboy, is merely a myth. 
 as joe buck migrates from place to place, he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself, only further degeneration. 
 during the opening credits, joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads` john wayne: the alamo.' 
 as joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show, a lady on the air describes her ideal man as` gary cooper? 
 but he 's dead.' 
 a troubled expression comes across joe 's face, as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone. 
 having adopted the image of a cowboy since youth, joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody. 
 joe 's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream.

"" 
 based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks, it 's set in 1960 in harwich, connecticut, where fatherless 11 year- old bobby garfield( anton yelchin) lives in a boarding house with his resentful, self- centered mother( hope davis). 
 he 's devoted to his neighborhood friends( mika boorem, will rothhaar) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange, new tenant, ted brautigan( anthony hopkins) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him, instead, a library card. 
 knowing he 's longing for a schwinn bike, ted offers to pay him$ 1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent, ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers. 
 the story structure consists of one long flashback, framed by the present, featuring the adult bobby( david morse), minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel, sensitive and benignly seductive. 
 the only explanation is that he 's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate, given the inexplicable state of the world right now.

 a compelling, at times poignant film 
, it manages to maintain its truthfulness while teetering between comedy and melodrama. 
 floating life centers around a hong kong family 's sense of dislocation and loss of identity after moving to australia in order to avoid the communist takeover of hong kong, and is divided into clearly defined vignettes, each chapter labelled with title cards pertaining to houses, which serves to emphasize the film 's theme of family. 
 the film opens with mr.

 this sets up a wonderfully amusing scene early in the film where the four immigrants, aimlessly ambling about their new suburban neighbourhood, are sent scrambling by the yelps of a little white puppy. 
 the tone set up early in the film is broadly comic, and one expects floating life to depict the clash of cultures as the chans struggle to acclimatize themselves to the new ways of australian life as they integrate themselves into australian society( a scene where the two teen sons meet up with a sunbathing neighbourhood girl is left dangling), but the film suddenly veers towards an introspective and melodramatic tone.

 critique:"" i feel like shooting myself in the head 
"" are the first words that came out of my mouth after seeing this movie, a good indication as to what kind of film to expect here. 
 this ai n't your average"" happy go lucky"" kind of picture. 
 this is a deliberately slow- paced mystery- horror film drenched in atmosphere, with a very creepy insane asylum( in which most of the film takes place), very few clues up- front and lots to talk about afterwards. 
 will it bore some people to sleep? 
 you bet it will! 
 is it made for the scream audiences of the day? 
 absolutely not! 
 i guess you can describe this film as a horror movie for the"" cerebral crowd"". 
 a film that patiently unwraps itself frame after frame, giving away very little with each step and each sound, unwinding itself until its final scenes offer up a world of revelations and plenty more to discuss later. 
 i 've always loved movies that have me talking about them afterwards like the shining and lost highway and this film fits right into that group. 
 in fact, i guess i can pussyfoot around the actual word all i want but the best way to describe this kind of movie is a"" mindfuck"". 
 if you feel like watching a movie that moves very slowly, gives you a handful of characters with divergent backgrounds, tosses a few very ambiguous and supernatural cookies your way and is extremely disturbing once you put it all together, well, 
 then this movie is definitely for you!

"with many big- budget science fiction films, great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts, cheesy plot twists, and, terrible acting. 
 the fifth element, the abyss, and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting, writing, or both. 
 at first glance, the matrix, larry& andy wachowski 's sci- fi/ kung- fu/ shoot- em- up spectacular, looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high- concept bad movies, especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role. 
 but despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue, the matrix works. 
 it 's an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films( most obviously the terminator films, star wars, and total recall), but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout 
. 
 reeves plays neo, a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with"" trinity""( carrie- anne moss), a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks, a unseen, omniscient cult figure known as"" morpheus""( lawrence fishburne), and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell. 
 neo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems. 
 moreover, he discovers that the grim, bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it. 
 neo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah, with grave doubts that he is actually"" the one"" prophesized to come and save the world.

"as fairy tales go, cinderella has to be one of the most famous. 
 almost everyone knows it, well at least in north america. 
 so it is natural that someone will try to make a movie out of it. 
 it has been done before with varying results. 
 this version of the story is both similar to the original and different at the same time. 
 the basic story remains unchanged but, one thing that seems to vanish with this version, and that is all the fantastical elements of the story. 
 there is no fairy god mother or anything even remotely of that nature. 
 after the fantastical elements are stripped away what is left is a realistic believable rendition of the cinderella story and an interesting love story at the least.. 
 unlike in the fairy tale, the prince plays a much larger part than just that of the masked ball at the end. 
 the? prince', who happens to be the crown prince to the throne of france, meets' cinderella', known as danielle, on a few occasions, most coincidentally 
 and he becomes smitten with her. 
 although this seems to be a far cry from the traditional story it allows for the main plot to proceed with enough room for some imaginative story telling.. 
 the story takes place in a renaissance setting; in france, with leonardo da vinci providing some comic relief on more than one occasion. 
 this addition of leonardo da vinci, was quite successful in that it added some color to the movie, since some of the roles are a bit stereotypical. 
 for example the role that was scripted for the prince leaves a few things to be desired. 
 for instance the character seems to be a bit too unstable and fickle, a crown prince should not be anything remotely like that. especially since he is portrayed to be in his mid twenties at the least and almost ready to take the throne. 
 the characters of danielle( cinderella) played by drew barrymore, and that of the evil step mother, played by anjelica huston, are well",positive,"The review praises the movie's unique take on the Cinderella story, appreciating the realistic rendition and the interesting love story.

"it stands as a moment one will not soon forget: a giant, green ogre flips through the pages of a cliche fairy tale, narrating it with every bit of dull inspiration that the story holds. 
 this leads one to believe that this serves as the prologue to shrek, dreamworks' second computer animated feature, but in a pricelessly hilarious bit of cinema, a page of this tale serves as that ogre 's toilet paper. 
 from this opening moment, one can infer shrek 's defying of all expectations regarding it as a standard, disney- esque fairy tale. 
 although rampant moments of hilarity dot shrek, the true charm of the film lies in the bold elements of friendship, courage, and acceptance, excelled by outstanding direction, stunning actor voice work, and most importantly, a witty screenplay with more going on than meets the eye. 
 while shrek features an abundance of humor related directly toward adults, positive friendship values aimed at younger children fulfill the storyline: shrek, the previously mentioned ogre, holds a position of absolute nothingness within his community. 
 the jolly green giant meets a fellow outsider, known only as the donkey( his species) who talks, and although he remains reluctant to warm up to him for a good portion of time, shrek eventually comes to a mutual understanding with him by acknowledging their common state as outcasts of the world. 
 the pair team up to retrieve princess fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon for the powerful lord farquaad, learning quite a bit about each other and themselves along the way. 
 their friendship exhibits the core theme of the need for someone to lean on, exemplifying to any child who may witness the film that acting as an honest companion can unquestionably affect someone. 
 shrek and donkey endure as supposed freaks of nature due only to their differences from others but cling to each other for support and guidance along their journey.

"for a movie about disco- era excess,"" 54"" comes up surprisingly short on the sleazy happenings at the titular late 1970s and early 1980s manhattan dance club. 
 think of it as a sort of"" boogie nights"" -lite- where that similarly- structured and -set portrayal of the porn industry was loaded with salacious goings- on and skidded on a destructive midpoint tone shift,"" 54"" leaves the kinkier details to your imagination. 
 it never needlessly revels in its seedy subject matter, but it thankfully never resorts to preaching, either. 
 in fact, were it not for the rampant drug use and the intermittent dark moment,"" 54"" would be about as feathery as the time period 's popular female hairstyle. 
 studio 54 was a haven for the rich, famous and generally good- looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986. 
 inside, anything went and, we are told, everything did. 
 the film 's fictional main character is shane o'shea( ryan phillippe, the jerky jock from 
"" i know what you did last summer""), a fresh- faced 19-year- old who dreams of venturing beyond the club 's velvet rope and coming face- to- face with the wild decadence he can only read about in magazines. 
 his wish comes true when studio 54 owner steve rubell( mike myers) spots him amongst a crowd of gawkers one night in' 79 and permits him passage- but not before he doffs his hideous shirt, of course. 
 once inside, shane becomes seduced by the club 's dizzying vortex of sex and drugs. 
 he has such a good time that he does n't want to leave, so he seeks employment as a busboy. 
 he quickly becomes friends with greg( breckin meyer) and anita( salma hayek), a married couple who work along side of him; greg 's a fellow busboy with aspirations to make the big money as a studio 54 bartender, while anita checks coats but desires a recording contract to call her own.

"in 1994, an insider 's look at a scandal- ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination( closely based on clinton 's 1992 campaign) was written anonymously( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship). 
 now, the book, primary colors, has been made into a movie, directed by mike nichols, and, in light of recent presidential scandals, seems to be more relevant than ever. 
 but the film is more than a diatribe against, or a paean in praise of, the president. 
 it is a fascinating look at the political machinery, and the ethical quagmire, that surround modern politics. 
 jack stanton( john travolta) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination. 
 he is charismatic, but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign, and strains his relationship with his wife, susan( emma thompson). 
 the film is told from the point of view of henry burton( adrian lester), grandson of a civil rights leader, who is swept away by stanton 's ideals and helps to organize the campaign. 
 he joins political strategist richard jemmons( billy bob thornton, looking an awful lot like james carville), and campaign advisor daisy green( maura tierney). 
 governor stanton 's past repeatedly pops up to haunt him, a fact that his chief rival, lawrence harris( kevin cooney), consistently uses to his advantage. 
 to help clean up the stanton campaign, jack and susan bring in an old friend, libby"" the dustbuster"" holden( kathy bates).

"eyes wide shut is n't the masterpiece many were hoping to see in stanley kubrick 's final film, but it is an impressive achievement; a mesmerizing, haunting, adult psychodrama about marriage, fidelity and sex.

 the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order: we open with young and dirt- poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy, peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky.

 this evolved into the adult periodical_ hustler_ magazine, creating larry flynt a vast financial empire, and the rest is history. 
 what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material, and who railed and preached against him- flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt- and his driven, single- minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression, regardless of personal cost.

 life and debt takes a brassy look at life inside this impoverished country. 
 while normal documentaries take the sally struthers approach of underlying scenes of starving children with tearful music, this film guides the viewer with a sarcastic voiceover that brings the troubles home without begging tears to the surface. 
 the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid.

 his very believable performance makes the long and uninteresting"" the hurricane"" a much better film than it actually is. 
 when his rubin"" hurricane"" carter feels pain and is tormented by racism, he creates for the audience a great sense of sympathy, disgust, and maybe even some embarrassment from the fact that this is our very own country that is breaking laws to support silly prejudices. 
 the horrific true events carter suffered from all of his life are slightly more disturbing and terrifying because they only took place a few decades ago. 
 the powerful expressions of denzel washington alone, as his tortured carter, sum up the troubles of racism in america 's history. 
 he is that amazing. 
 the problem with"" the hurricane"" is that when compared to washington, all of the other actors are not nearly as memorable in their roles. 
 mainly because the script focuses so much on carter, that it leaves little interest or room for the other actors. 
 this is, without a doubt, washington 's movie but in order for any film to be completely satisfying, it must utilize everyone in the cast to their highest potential not just the stars. 
 denzel washington is the only reason to see this film for his inspirational and very depressing tour de force performance. 
 as rubin carter, we see a black man whose existence has been a punching bag for the white american court system.

" note: after claiming otherwise, my appetite was indeed whetted by kenneth branagh 's hamlet to search out other attempts to translate shakespeare to film in hopes of finding a better mousetrap. 
 as it happens, it did n't take long. 
] is there a more romantic director than franco zeffirelli? 
 known mainly to american audiences as the man behind 1968 's romeo and juliet( required viewing for many high schoolers, and as much as most ever learn of shakespeare), he is also a favorite at the metropolitan opera, where his achingly beautiful designs further the already lush emotion of many a puccini aria. 
 last year he gave us his beautifully realized version of jane eyre, one of the twin peaks( with wuthering heights) of romantic literature. 
 it might seem peculiar, then, that zeffirelli ever had an interest in translating hamlet for the screen. 
 at first blush, hamlet is far removed from romance. 
 the hero, though a prince, is depressed, conflicted and confused. 
 the ostensible love interest gets little screen time, and her scenes with her prince are usually as an object of mockery. 
 the plot is full of political intrigue and the players are as cursed as the house of atreus. 
 it is zeffirelli 's genius, however, that he is able to expose the romantic core of hamlet and give the sometimes dry tale an emotional embrace. 
 in this italian master 's hands, romance is everywhere -- in a son 's worship of his father, in the bonds of deepest friendship, in the private thoughts of young lovers, even in the mystery of castles by the sea. 
 after all, the story hinges on a ghost, and what could be more romantic than that? 
 what seemed like a cheap way to sell tickets at the time turned out to be one of the most romantic gestures of all, namely, hiring then- reigning hollywood hunk mel gibson to play the lead. who could believe that the man who made his mark playing mad max and a"" lethal weapon""( in the series of the",positive,The review praises the director Franco Zeffirelli for his romantic approach to the film.

"the happy bastard 's quick movie review me tarzan... 
 you happy viewer. 
 for a minute there, i thought i was going to be groaning over the release of disney 's latest, another adaptation of a legend from the past. 
( remember the pathetic pocahontas? yikes!) 
 but guess what- disney, a company that 's been on a roll lately with animated films 
, strikes again with another wonderful tale that pleases the eyes as well as the inner kid in you. 
 the story is pretty basic- tarzan is left orphaned and a female gorilla who 's lost her young adopts him into her group. as he matures into a much older man, tarzan still wonders just why he 's so much different from the clan, and then arrives a hunter, a professor, and the professor 's lovely daughter, jane- who meets tarzan rather quickly after getting in trouble with a group of feisty babboons. 
 from there, tarzan faces tough choices- 
 should he stay with the ones that he grew up with or go join his own kind in england? 
 the voicework here is pretty top- level. 
 tony goldwyn is very convincing as the ape man; minnie driver adds a delectable touch to the already- beautiful jane; nigel hawthorne makes for a pretty nasty hunter voice; rosie o' donnell keeps the laughs rolling as tarzan 's best ape friend terk; and wayne"" newman"" knight has his moments as a panicky elephant. 
 the movie is superb throughout, mixing a great script with incredible computer- assisted visuals. 
 when tarzan tree- surfs( a twist that was added on top of the same ol' vine swinging- and a great one, i might add), the camera twists and turns, allowing the trees all around to come to life vividly.

"one of the funniest carry on movies and the third with a medical setting. 
 the main story is about dr. 
 james nookey( jim dale) who is disliked by his superiors, frederick carver, head of the hospital( kenneth williams), and dr. 
 ernest stoppidge( charles hawtrey) who seems to dislike everyone. 
 they attempt to cause him as much trouble in the hospital as possible and all the blame is laid on nookey. 
 carver learns of a possible job opportunity from wealthy ellen moore( joan sims) on a distant tropical island and gets nookey trannsferred there. 
 when nookey arrives at this island, he meets gladstone screwer( sid james) who has lived on the island just about all his life. 
 screwer is in possession of a wonderful slimming drug made from natural ingredients. 
 dr. 
 nookey returns with the drug to england and sets up a new slimming business with ellen moore 's financial backing. 
 however, nookey and moore face opposition from screwer who goes to england to cash in on the drug, and carver and stoppidge who want to know the ingredients to create a rival drug. 
 the performances are all very commendable. 
 sid james has a slightly ambiguous character to play this time and he excels in his role. 
 kenneth williams, as usual, plays the unpopular and cunning head of the hospital. 
 joan sims is entertaining as the wealthy benefactor and jim dale should really head the cast with his excellent portrayal of bumbling nookey. 
 charles hawtrey plays an' out- of- character' role as dr. 
 stoppidge, the nasty and evil practitioner who wants to knock nookey off his perch. 
 some critics have said that this combination of hawtrey and stoppidge does not work well, but i think that it at least gives hawtrey a new part to play instead of the usual dimwit characters.

"whenever writer/ director robert altman works in a specific genre, he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms. 
 he made the west dirty in"" mccabe and mrs. 
 miller""( 1971), he parodied hard- boiled detective stories in"" the long goodbye""( 1973), and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with"" popeye""( 1980). 
 the same holds true for his most recent film,"" the gingerbread man,"" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years: the john grisham movie. 
 by the time"" the gingerbread man"" was completed, there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham. 
 there 's no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise, matthew mcconaughey, chris o'donnell or matt damon, and it does n't feature a great showdown in a courtroom. 
 instead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession,"" the gingerbread man"" is a rain- soaked, southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters, a twisting plot line, black humor, a somewhat bleak ending, and even altman 's trademark full- frontal female nudity. 
 the central character of the film is rick magruder, who is unlike any of grisham 's other lawyer heroes. 
 he is older, experienced, and rich; he drives a cherry- red$ 80, 000 mercedes that never gets dirty, even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah, georgia, where the story unfolds. 
 rick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife, leeanne( famke janssen), and he rarely gets to see his two children, jeff( jesse james) and libby( mae whitman).

"errol morris, critically acclaimed director of the 1997 documentary fast, cheap and out of control, 
 vaults to new heights with mr. 
 death. 
 this film, an examination of the life and work of controversial execution equipment designer and revisionist historian fred a. leuchter, jr., is sure to draw audiences out of their malaise, stunning even the more jaded minds among us. 
 do n't let the film 's cheesy dissuade you. 
 following this sideshow of horror- lab special effects we are plunged quickly into a non- stop exploration of the weirdness that is leuchter 's life and mind. 
 morris follows the trail of leuchter 's madness with appalling lucidity, revealing in a surprising and frightening way what most of us could have guessed to begin with: this leuchter guy is seriously messed up. virtually raised within the american penal system by a father who worked within prison walls, leuchter seems to have come somewhat naturally into his profession; designing and maintaining execution equipment for state penitentiaries, in spite of his lack of credentials. 
 after a moderately successful career making electric chairs and designing gas chambers and gallows, leuchter came to the attention of neo- nazi and revisionist historian ernst zundel, who was facing criminal charges in germany for publishing his` theory' that the holocaust never happened. 
 morris 's interviews are surprisingly congenial, drawing the subjects into a carefree banter that gives them more than enough rope with which to hang themselves. 
 zundel speaks to the camera as though it were his mensch. 
 leuchter seems completely at ease, sometimes jovial. 
 part of this effect may be due to morris 's new interviewing machine, called the interrotron, which is responsible for creating eye contact between the subject and the interviewer. 
 this was the first time morris had used the device, and the results are startling. 
 combine the irony of these interviews with leuchter 's reenactments and reels of creepy stock footage of his trip to auschwitz and birkenau, not to mention a haunting clip of thomas edison electrocuting an elephant, and

 the play was so successful that the film rights were immediately snapped up and production on the film began a mere year later, in october of 1974.

 deliverance was a real shocker for it 's time( 1972). 
 major advances were being made in films, and deliverance made its own advances when it introduced a new horror into the film industry. 
 when it was first released, it literally shocked the audiences. 
 it was something that, for the most part, had really never been seen on the big screen before( among wide- release films with an r rating). 
 but by today 's film standards and in today 's world, such scenes as the one in deliverance can be reproduced in a way that is n't as shocking, although they can be even more graphic( e. g. pulp fiction). 
 pulp fiction did it in a way, and expanded on it in a way, that it could even be interpreted as funny.

"brian depalma needs a hit* really* badly. 
 since scoring big with the untouchables in 1987, depalma has seen casualties of war, raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames. 
 consequently, it would be easy enough to consider carlito 's way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma, reteaming with al pacino( scarface) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes. 
 it does n't hurt any that 
 he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn. 
 carlito 's way, while hampered by depalma 's characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism, is a truly tense and engrossing drama. 
 carlito brigante( pacino) is a life- long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance. 
 in 1975, carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality. 
 he declares himself reformed, tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas. 
 among those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld( penn), carlito 's crooked attorney and childhood friend, and bodyguard pachanga( luis guzman). 
 carlito rediscovers old flame gail( penelope ann miller), and seems ready to retire in peace. 
 old ways die hard, though, and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he ca n't seem to shake. 
 carlito 's way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film. 
 in the first, carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station.

"i 've never been a huge fan of jeff bridges, but i loved him in the big lebowski. 
 the part of jeff"" the dude"" lebowski was reportedly written specifically with bridges in mind, and the fit is perfect. 
 the dude is an unemployed denizen of los angeles, a hippie slob on a bowling team with a soft spot for white russians. 
 he 's enjoying a leisurely soak in the tub when two thugs break into his apartment demanding to be paid for the money his wife owes. 
 after much pleading he convinces them they have the wrong guy, but not before they urinate on his rug. 
 the dude assumes that these"" collection agents"" were after another jeff lebowski, a famous millionaire who also lives in l.

 so he goes to meet his namesake to ask for enough money to replace his rug. 
 the millionaire refuses, but calls him back when he discovers his wife has been kidnaped. 
 he wants the dude to act as go- between for the kidnapers. 
 dude and his friend walter( john goodman) take on the task, and get caught in an intricate web of kidnapers, millionaires, high schoolers, nihilists, artists, pornographers, thugs, and league bowlers. 
 comedy is perhaps the most subjective of genres, so take my recommendation as you will: for me, the big lebowski is very funny. 
 it is an incredibly successful comedy, the ratio of laughs to intended jokes much higher than in most films. 
 not only are the two leads( bridges and goodman) funny separately and together, but each supporting character is a refreshing comic figure. 
 all the characters end up as the butt of jokes, but the jokes are always deserved and never contrived. 
 each person may be a comic caricature, but there is always a respectful self- acceptance that lets us laugh at these people without condescension.

"us critic- type people are always shaking our heads and telling everyone that movies are n't thrill rides, but i think that"" back to the future ii"" is one of the few exceptions. 
 if the original film had the spirit of the 1950s, then this has the spirit of the 80s: full of fights; chase scenes; cliff hangers; special effects; some detective work; and of course the vision of the high- tech future. 
 the film picks up exactly where the first film left off, with doc( lloyd), marty( fox), and jennifer( elizabeth shue) travelling 30 years into the future, because something bad is going to happen to marty and jennifer 's kids. 
 doc tells marty he must take his son 's place at an incident that will cause a chain reaction if marty mcfly jr. 
 says yes to griff( wilson- in one of four different roles). 
 whoever said history tends to repeat itself was n't joking, especially when it comes to the movies. 
 essentially the same chase scene that marty endured in the 50s takes place again in the year 2015, but it 's not as authentically exciting this time because it is so obviously a parody of itself. 
 at the end of the situation marty has changed the course of history for the better, and it seems like everything 's copasetic right? 
 wrong. 
 since when do things go according to plan in the"" back to the future"" movies? 
 there are so many minor conflicts and details that effect the plot and the direction of the story i wo n't even bother to list them all. 
 basically we get to see marty as an old man, his house, his family, etc. 
 we also go back to an alternate 1985, and then back again to 1955, with everything happening so fast the film never stops to catch a breath.

"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings. 
 a prime example of this is 1999 's 10 things i hate about you, which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school. 
 less successful was last year 's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp. 
 here the setting was the corporate world of new york. 
 now comes o, a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare 's tragedies. 
 like 10 things i hate about you, the stage is a high school- a private prep school where odin james( mekhi phifer) is the on- court general, the basketball team 's standout player. 
 julia stiles, featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke 's hamlet, plays desi brable, odin 's girlfriend, whose father also happens to be dean of the institution. 
 josh hartnett( pearl harbor) is on hand for the villainy, playing the scheming hugo, who sets the tragic wheels in motion. 
 o was actually filmed a couple of years ago, but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy. 
 the movie, directed by tim blake nelson- best known for his co- starring role in o brother, where art thou?- and written by brad kaaya, is very grim. 
 an air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits. 
 and that is how it should be. 
 of all of shakespeare 's tragedies, othello is the most harrowing, not because of any body count, but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago, whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery.

"director david fincher has such an eye for detail which is very rare in hollywood these days( terry gilliam comes to mind as another one). 
 film is one of the best art forms because not only can you tell a story, but you can use the camera to capture the smallest detail and have it mean something.

"originally launched in 1978, this popular film was re- introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers. 
 based on the mighty successful musical from broadway, grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2( 6. 5/10), starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles. 
 plot: high- school musical set in the 1950 's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t- birds( travolta) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen( newton- john) from australia. 
 the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song, dance and humour. 
 critique 
: fun- loving, energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler. 
 this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950 's, with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers. 
 admittedly, i am somewhat biased in this opinion, since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth( grease was one of schmoe 's first big- screen experiences, and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble- gum card collection), and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time. 
 but apart from the nostalgic vibe, i was still extremely impressed by this film, as it continued to amuse me, despite my previous dozen or so viewings. 
 this film took john travolta from a dim- witted"" sweathog"" on tv 's welcome back kotter, and transformed him into a movie- star of spectacular proportions( saturday night fever( 7. 5/10) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity). 
 unfortunately for the rest of the cast, his popularity was not terribly contagious, despite their effective showings in this classic movie.

 christian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman, a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc? 
 e and his colleagues. 
 it seems that bateman is a serial killer and, unfortunately for his contemporaries, his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip. 
 as he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co- workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies, his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel. 
 i was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school. 
 i read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it. 
 as usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out, but i soon forgot about the novel and did n't end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore. 
 i picked it up and read it, but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers. 
 the movie has a similar effect, but at least it 's less cryptic than ellis' novel. 
 for once, a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on. 
 both the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout. 
 the movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman 's impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does. as a result, the film is immensely more entertaining.

" 
 i 'd rather die today and go to heaven than live to be a hundred and go to hell,"" earnestly proclaims the pentecostal preacher. 
 with that line coming from a fundamentalist christian minister, hollywood has taught us how we should fill in the rest of the story. 
 he will be turn out to be a scoundrel who has less actual belief in god than the average american, and all of his preaching will turn out to be a cynical ruse to extort money from his naive congregation. 
 from elmer gantry on, we have learned what to expect when the movies go to church. 
 well, think again, for the apostle, which robert duvall has wanted to make for over a decade, does not take the usual tack of smearing the minister, and by implication all, the rest of organized religion. 
 instead it gives us a highly devout man, who certainly has his foibles, but with an absolute dedication to his ministry and his god. 
 and arguably just as surprising, the good- spirited film is no comedy, even if it does have humorous moments. 
 instead of levity the picture takes a touchingly serious approach as it introduces us to a world not normally seen in motion pictures. 
 when in the privacy of his attic, robert duvall, as texas preacher euliss"" sonny"" dewey, argues sternly with his lord, the scene shares a kinship with emily watson 's character crying out for her god in breaking the waves 's most powerful scene.

"one of the best movies i 've ever seen. 
 i 'd heard extremely good things about this movie, and though the previews did n't really intrigue that much, it was a movie i 'd been anticipating for a few months now.

"this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989. whether it was the meddling of studio executives, or the work of writer/ director james cameron himself, the original cut of this underwater sci- fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed. 
 the main problem was fairly simple: the film 's climax was unworthy of its build- up.

 nicholson deserves the top billing he is receiving in the posters and opening credits since his astounding, oscar- worthy performance as the joker is the highlight of batman. 
 nicholson shows no inhibition or shame as he pulls out all the stops to create a joker that makes cesar romero look like bozo the clown( romero played the joker in the' 60s tv series). 
 on one hand, nicholson 's joker is extremely funny. 
 his murderous escapades and manic outbursts( which include defacing paintings in an art museum and invading the television airwaves with hilarious pirate broadcasts) bring humor and laughter into an otherwise dark film. 
 but on the other hand, his outwardly jovial disposition is only a mask for his intense contempt for all of mankind. 
 the joker 's cruelty and demented, diabolical nature are truly frightening and sinister. 
 this guy is off his rocker, and he not only knows it, he flaunts it! 
 but enough about nicholson as the joker: i 'm sure most people are wondering about michael keaton as batman. 
 like many, i was outraged when warner brothers announced that keaton had been cast as the caped crusader. 
 but batfans need not worry because holy unconventional casting! 
 keaton delivers.

"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s.

 played by patrick mcgoohan) has almost completely subdued entire british isles, including scotland, whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by"" ius primae noctis"" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights. 
 although english had killed his father many years ago, young scottish commoner william wallace( played by mel gibson) does n't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron( played by catherine maccormack). 
 murron 's death changes that and wallace takes arms and, together with small but dedicated band of followers, begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country.

 what bonnie and clyde stole, mickey and mallory kill. 
 to examine natural born killers as nothing more than a psychological odyssey of realization and exposure of the frauds surrounding them, expressed metaphorically as killing, subdues the mysterious power this film wields. 
 for the most part, when mickey and mallory kill, they kill all that frustrates them unnecessarily, they kill what is trying to kill them, they kill what dissembles and cowers from life, they kill what needs to be killed.

"john sayles'"" men with guns"" is about what happens to a society when brute force and constant threat of violence are the only means of gaining and maintaining power.

 that is especially true for those who end up somewhere in that unexplored land between los angeles and new york where they find, to their big surprise, that the majority of people vote republican, go to church every sunday and usually do n't tolerate liberal attitudes that are taken for granted in an average american film. 
 such rude awakening, however, can happen in another direction- conservative people are sometimes forced to discover unpleasant truths about world they live in.

"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element, substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject, but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents. 
 and, unlike any of the more outlandish myths, the vampire holds some real- world probability( one study claims 1, 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide, and places 50 in los angeles). 
 but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys, john carpenter would like to remind us that they are- and always have been- a truly frightening element of the thriller genre. and remind us he does in his latest film, vampires. 
 there was some question, as halloween weekend approached, of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema 's immensely successful blade, released in august. 
 the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue, and do n't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method. 
( for instance, blade 's main weapons are silver and garlic, whereas main character jack crow 's technique is a wooden stake to the heart.) 
 blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization, while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate. 
 both have their advantages, and here, carpenter 's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered.

"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue, we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia. 
 although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories( mostly in ironic way, like grosse pointe blank and romy& michelle 's high school reunion), some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones. 
 until that happens, 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed, when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel, materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters.

"the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas? has made the film out to be a comedy, and for about the first hour 
 or so it seems like it might be one. 
 it 's 1971, and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash- outs, among them journalist raoul duke( johnny depp) and his"" attorney"" dr. 
 gonzo( benito del toro). 
 these two spend most of the film in a drug- induced stupor, having strange hallucinations, trashing their hotel rooms, and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path. 
 duke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas, but gets lost in a blur of drugs, beer, and flying dust, and ends up wandering around with no clue who won. 
 he leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back, in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate, to cover a drug enforcement conference. 
 fear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs. 
 it does n't, even in the beginning -- while the pair 's antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first, the humor here is still fairly dark. 
 director terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye, and even when we 're laughing, we 're laughing at them rather than with them. 
 they spend most of their time paranoid, angry, or just plain befuddled, which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles. 
 the black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen, but it 's probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first- hand. 
 all this aside, i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one- hour mark, thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off- kilter satire of drug culture.

"james cmaeron 's breakthrough feature was the first of his films to showcase his obsession with technology and more specfically technology run amok. 
 for those of you who do not know the plot: in 2029 machines have engineered a nuclear for the expressed purpose of wiping out the human race. 
 human survivors are systematically hunted down and destroyed. 
 however, some humans are fighting back led by the heroic john connor. 
 to stop connor, the machines send a terminator( arnold schwarzenegger) back to 1984 to murder connor 's mother, sara( linda hamilton), and thus prevent connor from ever being born. 
 in response, the humans send a protector, kyle reese, played by michael biehn. 
 images of machines and of humans' reliance on machines dominate the film. 
 even though the characters know that the benign oil drillers of 1984 will become the ruthless hunter killers of 2029, humans continue to use the machines. 
 in the climax of star wars, luke relies on the force alone -- his own spiritual power -- to destroy the death star. 
 in the terminator, however, sara must use another machine -- a giant hydraulic press -- to vanquish her enemy. 
 cameron seems to be implying that this reliance on technology is inescapable -- and he 's not happy about it.

 it bears some resemblance, story- wise, to the coens' recent"" fargo,"" but even the darkly satirical humor and the enjoyably quirky characterizations that characterized that film are scarce here;"" blood simple"" is pretty much cold and brutal from beginning to end. 
 the premise of"" blood simple"" is really just a slight variation on the standard love- triangle/ revenge scheme: sleazy bar owner julian marty( dan hedaya) hires a shifty private detective( m. emmet walsh) to kill his wife abby( frances mcdormand) and her illicit lover ray( john getz). 
 things start to go haywire when walsh decides instead to fake the murder with photographic trickery but, upon collecting the money, becomes uncertain as to whether or not marty is capable of keeping his mouth shut about the scheme. 
 to reveal any more details of the story would be to give away too much, but what ensues is a series of bloody( and i do mean bloody) confrontations, each triggered by one or more characters misunderstanding what is actually happening. 
 every act of violence or deception in this film makes sense when seen through the perpetrator 's eyes, but we, the audience, are made privy to the"" big picture"" and thus can recognize that each misdeed is somehow either unnecessary or directed at the wrong person. 
 this aspect of the story, along with the intense atmosphere of repulsion and brutality- one gets the sense that if guns and, in one case, shovels, were not available, some of these characters would claw each other to death- are the most effective components of the film.

"kirk douglas is one of those rare american actors who can say more with a simple glance than most can say with pages of dialogue. 
 all he has to do is look at someone with a raised eyebrow, and you instantly know what he 's thinking. 
"" detective story"" features one of kirk douglas 's finest performances. 
 he stars as a new york detective that has his whole world fall apart in one night. 
 the film is based on a play, and this is quite evident, as most of the movie takes place in the one- room flat that the detective 's work in. 
 the film opens with the douglas character getting ready to go home to his wife, but through a series of events, he never quite makes it there. 
 the bulk of the movie follows the case of a man named schneider, a surgeon who routinely performs abortions with a high fatality rate. 
 however, this schneider character has a connection in the past of douglas 's wife; a connection douglas himself is not aware of. 
 many secrets are revealed in the last half hour of this film.

"jacques tati 's 1953 classic"" les 
 vacances 
 de m. hulot""( also known as"" mr. 
 hulot 's vacation,"" in english) ought to be the textbook on how to do non? 
 dialogue comedy in film. 
 the characters hardly ever speak to each other directly, and the film operates on the paper? 
 thin premise that monsieur hulot, played by tati himself, is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week 's vacation. 
 yet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory. 
 part of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags. 
 slapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy, but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced: you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face- first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people do n't watch where they 're going. 
 in"" les vacances de m. hulot,"" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low- key. 
 in one sequence, for example, hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when, while his back is turned, the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves, washes away, then comes back up on the other side of the boat. 
 while crossing over to get the can, hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it. 
 when he actually takes the boat out into the water, it breaks in half, but the two halves flip up against each other, trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues.

"i had lost all faith in pg-13 movies that are intended for teenagers and adults. 
 the last dozen or so that i have seen have all felt incomplete, as if the most crucial scene was deleted in order to obtain a more lucrative rating. 
 however, after seeing the creative frequency last week and now the exciting u-571, my bias is beginning to go away. 
 both films are as innocuous for younger viewers as they are intellectual for older viewers. 
 even better, i did n't think either one of these films would be any good from first instincts. 
 everyone loves surprises. 
 u-571 looked like another action film using an actual war as an excuse to shoot torpedoes and bullets. 
 this may be true, but the action is so extraordinary that it is clear director/ co- writer jonathan mostow completed his ultimate goal; to blow the audience 's socks off. 
 set during the early stages of world war 2 when the united states struggled to break the codes of the technologically advanced german u- boats, u-571 follows a small crew of american men who swipe the typewriter necessary to solve the enigma from an enemy ship. 
 there 's only one problem: the american ship they came from and hoped to return to has been shot down stranding the men on a german submarine known as( you guessed it) 
 u-571. 
 it is now up to the mostly young and inexperienced sailors, led by an interim captain named tyler( matthew mcconaughey), to return the typewriter to america without getting sunk by far superior german ships. 
 the film starts off very slowly with a somewhat weak opening action sequence and another uneventful half an hour to introduce several of the sailors( most of whom die when the mission goes awry or just inexplicably disappear).

 george clooney is the protagonist, a risky choice after such duds as batman and robin and the peacemaker, but for once i did n't want to slap the taste out of his mouth. 
 he plays his role in out of sight as the suave cary grant- type perfected in hitchcock movies, the kind of guy to whom crime is just a profession like any other. 
 nowhere present is clooney 's usual ain't- i- sexy sneer -- there 's just enough leftover lightheartedness to fit in with the leonard style. 
 clooney is definitely a perfect successor to john travolta in get shorty. 
 clooney plays a man who 's robbed about 200 banks without ever using a gun. 
 in the opening scene, he walks into one bank and robs it not only with ease but with charm. 
 of course, he gets caught, so it 's not all good. 
 it 's while doing time in a florida prison that clooney learns of one rich inmate 's( albert brooks in a frightful bald wig) collection of diamonds in detroit. 
 clooney and cohort ving rhames plan the score, while protection artist and fight promoter don cheadle begins rival plans. 
 meanwhile, there 's jennifer lopez. 
 unintentionally funny in selena and intentionally funny in anaconda, she 's finally graduated to a worthy role as the u. s. 
 marshal who happens to be driving up to the jail on the night clooney escapes.

 his films all seem to have one style, bleak. 
 the worlds he creates are terrifying and cold. 
 little known in the us to date, his films deliver the kind of horror that so many of our filmmakers promise and are unable to deliver. 
 most of his ideas are fresh and at the same time morbid. 
 his 1998 film cure, with one of his niftiest ideas, is just now getting a sadly limited release in the us and hopefully enough people will see it that his name will soon be one to conjure with. 
 cure is probably his classic. 
 last year he released seance, a remake of seance on a wet afternoon.

 i was worried that disney was going to make another hercules( sorry, jerk- ules).

 when i bought the soundtrack, i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features. 
 i have never really heard of phil collins, nor have i heard of mark mancina, so i was wondering, how would these two make this disney flick spin? 
 i was pleasantly surprised: the music is top- notch. 
 phil collins' songs are terrific, percussion- heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs. 
 the score from mark mancina was also neat

 as a millionaire leading a massive conspiracy in order to rob"" a process"" from a clueless businessman, martin 's character did it all for money. 
 in his most recent movie, bowfinger, martin plays yet another con man except this time he does it to succeed in the film industry.

 playing the title role, martin is once again the good guy; 
 the one we cheer for to complete his low budget action movie. 
 this con man is very likeable for some reason, even though he is doing the same exact thing as the malicious jimmy del from the spanish prisoner.

"along his carreer, mel gibson has collected several successes, not only from an economic point of view but also from an artistic point of view. 
 for all that, i think no one could guess the skills and abilities now disclosed in braveheart. 
 the australian actor decided to produce and direct a film about sir william wallace, a popular scotch hero of the 13th century, where he would also perform the principal role. accepting so huge challenge, mel gibson run the risk of stain all his work of years, with a suppoosed failure, just to see recognized, by everyone, all his potentialities and, that way, to consolidate his position in hollywood. 
 it was, definitely, an enormous risk 
 but i 'm sure mel knew exactly well what he was going to face. 
 braveheart is, in fact, a magnificent and magisterial film. 
 for three hours we are completely absorbed by the narrative 's rhyitm which never gives place to a single moment of monotony or uninterest. 
 the william wallace 's story is the story of so many others brave liberty 's defenders who fought and gave the life for that essential value, along the centuries. 
 seeing himself and his people victims of injustices and violent repression, william wallace dares to face the powerful edward i, king of england, in a war by the autonomy of scotland. 
 as the victories succeed the number of fighters with wallace goes growing up.

"renown surrealist director, the 77-year- old frenchman alain resnais( hiroshima, mon amour/ last year at marienbad/ m? lo), has created a lighthearted musical played as an homage to britisher dennis potter and his pennies from heaven( 1978 tv serial, 1981 movie) and the singing detective( 1986). 
 the film follows potter 's gimmicky style of having the characters jump into lip- synched old or contemporary french pop songs to express their private thoughts. 
 he also follows the kind of sweet and colorful musicals his fellow countryman jacques demy loved to direct, such as"" the umbrellas of cherbourg"" and"" the young girls of rochefort. 
"" 
 the tale has resnais 's unique touches as a director to go along with his homage. 
 it is a satire about class differences and falling in love with the wrong person, and that there is a song in everyone 's heart for every occasion. 
 what hinders this production is that the stars are not portraying particularly engaging characters, the songs are not memorable and stand little chance of being recognized by an american audience( the exceptions might be the edith piaf and maurice chevalier numbers), and the farce seems more banal than daring. 
 yet it is not without its striking moments and charms, such as when jane birkin does a cameo and sings one of her own songs. 
 also, the glossy amberlike photography added a very french romantic feeling to the story, while the mood of paris as being a place for love to flourish above all else, which has always been embellished in movie lore, comes through with flying colors. 
 it also does a good job of showing you the way paris is in the 1990s and in the way ordinary people exist there.

"in 1987 the stock market crashed, and oliver stone 's wall street was released to critical acclaim and packed movie houses. 
 wall street lucked out in its timing; the recent crash gave the film a resonation it might not of had, and though its kill- or- be- killed approach to business was exaggerated, that very ideology was keyed into the mind set of the quintessential reagan- era businessman. 
 stone constructed his film as a mythical good vs. 
 evil tale relayed in the fast- paced milieu of the burgeoning stock exchange. 
 critics and audiences lauded wall street, elevating its status to that of a contemporary classic. 
 i 'm proud to say that i will never be counted as one of them. 
 i found wall street to be just as axiomatic and pandering as the majority of stone 's output with its thin caricatures, obvious sentiments, and a charisma barren performance by the young charlie sheen. 
 stone goes for broke in every scene( the same could be said for nearly all of his works). 
 this approach tends to bury his purported message beneath a heap of good intentions. 
 he directs stock exchange scenes in typical hyperbolic mode with people shouting into phones as if they were in a plummeting airplane. 
 it 's all an excuse for stone to ratchet up the emotion with false intensity, rather than explore what these situations are really like.

 maybe that 's where you met your significant other, and, had you reached the platform just a few seconds later? 
 film makers are no less fascinated by issues of destiny than anyone else, and that 's why there 's no shortage of movies about this subject. 
 the best of the bunch were probably made by the late polish director krzysztof kieslowski, who was obsessed with questions of fate and chance. 
 these themes weave their way through many of his movies, including decalogue, the double life of veronique, and the triptych of blue, white, and red. 
 however, they are most explicitly examined in a 1981 film called blind chance, where kieslowski presents the three different fates of one man after a minor action( missing or catching a train) 
 changes the course of his life.

"note: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers. be forewarned. 
 east meets west in mulan, the latest installment in disney 's parade of annual animated feature films. 
 an odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass- market commercial sensibilities, this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years, but falls short of actualizing its potential. 
 though not for lack of trying. 
 in many respects, mulan is among disney 's most mature efforts, skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat. 
 the violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village, neatly encapsulated in the form of a child 's discarded doll, is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars, and mulan 's later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy, bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film, long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent, dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner? 
 in an instant, idealistic mulan 's innocence is lost, and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending. 
 the film, based upon an ancient chinese fable, centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family 's obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones, replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger- edged teeth, although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace). 
 dipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western/ european fables and literature for decades, disney 's new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere, story intact, to some neutral territory, and revels in its east asian roots; aside from a predominantly asian- american cast providing the film 's vocal work, there 's liberal usage",positive,The review appreciates the film's mature efforts and its exploration of adult themes and the messier side of combat.

"capsule: bleak and point- blank -- just the way it should be. makes its case with cold- blooded precision and intelligence. 
"" serial killer chic"" is a relatively new entry to the cultural vocabulary, and one of the more stomach- turning ones. 
 i 've never found someone automatically admirable or even interesting because they killed creatively or in great numbers, and because of that i had apprehensions about seeing henry. 
 i was n't sure i wanted to see the story of multiple murderer henry lee lucas portrayed as some kind of nihilistic hero/ antihero. 
 thankfully, that 's not the way henry works. 
 the director, john mcnaughton, took a small budget and a gallery of actor friends and created a chilling and intelligent piece of work. 
 it does n't provide cheap- jack explanations for henry 's behavior: it shows him up for what he is, an unrepentant and un- idolizable man who killed when the mood struck him. 
 at the film 's opening, henry 's friend ottis toole has a sister, who comes by to stay while she tries to find work in chicago. 
 in a viciously riveting scene, he admits matter- of- factly to having murdered his own mother, and she covers his hand with hers. 
 they are damned together from that moment on. 
 henry and ottis eventually begin to kill for fun. 
 the movie is especially good at showing how they seem to have drifted casually into it: there 's a scene where the two go to buy a new tv. 
 the pawnbroker they talk to goads henry with ugly words, and henry responds by stabbing the man to death with a soldering iron. 
 no preface -- it smashes into us as suddenly as it does the broker.

"melvin van peebles'"" sweet sweetback 's baadasssss song"" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement. 
 it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident. 
 its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before. 
 in style, content, and how it was conceived and produced,"" sweet sweetback"" was a cinematic revolution, whether or not one agrees with its subject matter. 
 van peebles, a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france, built"" sweet sweetback"" from the ground up almost entirely by himself. 
 because no studio would dare fund such a film, he was forced to raise all the money himself. 
 the movie ended up costing about$ 500, 000, part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby. 
 van peebles cut costs by hiring non- union labor and taking on most of the film 's responsibilities himself. 
 he wrote the script, scored the music, edited and directed the film, as well as starred in the central role. 
 he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck. 
 for instance, when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x- rating, van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa, but he also developed a little marketing scheme: 
 he coined the phrases"" rated x by an all- white jury,"" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film. 
 he also printed the phrase on tee- shirts which he had no problem selling.

 is it possible to remain unperturbed that a woman of this age is playing a high school student? harder still, can you avoid astonishment at how perfect she is in the part? with the sure, showy expertise of a de niro, taylor imbues unwed mother patti with all the faux fuck- you confidence she can muster. 
 it 's a deeply felt, dead- on performance, and by the halfway point you 've forgiven taylor her own maturity. 
 for all its verite pretenses, girls town is less about a bunch of high- schoolers than it is about a movie director and a cadre of writer- performers examining their own feelings about rape, relationships, and american womanhood. 
 the movie 's opening scenes sketch an easy friendship between a group of four smart/ sassy high school outsiders on the verge of graduation: 
 patti, angela( bruklin harris), emma( anna grace), and nikki( aunjanue ellis). 
 but about 10 minutes into the film, we get word that nikki has swallowed a fistful of pills and bowed out of life. 
 the remaining girls manage to smug nikki 's diary out of her grieving mother 's home, and page through it at patti 's place, investigating the root of nikki 's despair. 
 what they find is cruel and galvanizing -- nikki had been raped by an editor at a newspaper where she interned, and was privately questioning the sanity and value of a world where such a thing could happen. 
 shell- shocked by the truth of the matter, the three girls begin to talk among themselves and come to a realization about their own lives.

 because of this, i will tread lightly so i do n't ruin it for anyone reading this review, and it would be very advisable to avoid all other material regarding this film until after you have seen it.

 the mono sound that the audience was subjected to sounded as if it was coming out of a speaker that was many years past mandatory retirement age. 
 in other words, the sound sucked. 
 as someone used to digital sound in a movie theater, bad sound does n't do anything to add to a film.

 my guess on the sound seems like a fairly solid one considering the visual quality of the matrix. 
 it is nothing short of stunning visually. 
 sadly, the rest of the film, while pretty good, does n't quite measure up to the obvious effort that was expended on making this film look so darn good.

"alchemy is steeped in shades of blue. 
 kieslowski 's blue, that is. 
 with its examination of death, isolation, character restoration, and recovery from loss, suzanne myers' new independent film echoes the polish director 's internationally- acclaimed 1993 release. 
 language aside, the principal difference between the films is that, while kieslowski took great pains to draw us into the main character 's world, alchemy keeps its viewers at arm 's length. 
 as a result, while we 're able to appreciate the film 's intellectual tapestry, it is emotionally distant. 
 alchemy is divided into three chapters:"" charity"","" faith"", and"" hope"". 
 while there are common themes and story elements running through all three, the single constant is the main character, a sculptor/ russian translator named louisa( rya kihlstedt). 
 when the film opens, she 's living with her painter boyfriend, whom she believes to be cheating on her. 
 following his sudden death in an automobile accident, louisa 's life is thrown into turmoil. 
 events swirls around her, and she ca n't find a source of stability. 
 in her quest to make sense out of her loss, she befriends her late boyfriend 's mistress, visits her ill sister, and, eventually, abandons her old life by joining a"" back- to- nature"" cult. 
 alchemy successfully explores a variety of compelling issues. 
 in addition to asking the basic question of how a person should cope with the unexpected death of a loved one, it probes beneath the surface of concepts like the importance of faith in the healing process, the meaning of love, and the nature of art. 
 does personality restoration come through interacting with others or escaping from the familiar? 
 are artistic epiphanies the result of focused solitude or of living life, with all of its various distractions, to the fullest? 
 myers' challenge is to make these subjects, art film staples, engrossing in a new context.

"capsule: this is a harrowing look at a rarely dramatized chapter of wwii, life in a japanese prison camp. 
 to end all wars is a moving film about the struggle of prisoners to retain their humanity and their dignity. 
 the somewhat religious interpretation may not be to everyone 's taste. 
, 
 +3( -4 to +4) more than any other people the japanese seem capable of acting with one goal and not letting any other consideration get in their way. 
 this may be a holdover from the code of bushido when loyalty to ones master was the only law. 
 during world war ii, of course, the one goal was winning the war. 
 this led them to do some very inhuman things in pursuit of that goal. 
 when the japanese had captured prisoners, they were very much treated in whatever way would be optimum for achieving the one goal. 
 minimum resources were to be spent in maintaining prisoners in keeping with maximal positive output. 
 while the germans, not known for their kindness in those days, had a 6% mortality rate among captured prisoners of war, the mortality rate of japanese prisoners of war was 27%. 
 the best thing for the war effort was working prisoners nearly to death on the thailand to burma railroad. 
 that railroad was needed if japan was to attack india as it planned to do. 
 the best thing for the effort was not to waste much food on the prisoners so short and amazingly wretched food was the order of the day. 
 and just being in the jungle without proper medical aid took its toll. 
 in the public mind japan has never been held as accountable for war atrocities as was germany. 
 filmmakers have been reticent to tell the story, perhaps for fear of offending the japanese.

 the script, by favreau, is great. 
 mike is always missing is girlfriend, who has n't called him for six months, and every time he meets a girl, he always end up telling her about the ex.

"a frequent error is the categorization of a terrorist as a soldier or a common criminal. 
 a soldier commits acts of violence sanctioned by one nation- state against another. 
 a common criminal commits acts of violence for personal gain. 
 a terrorist employs random violence as a means to a political end. 
 if the target nation does not affect the desired change in policy, the violence continues. 
 it is the fear resulting from the fact that the terrorist may strike at anyone( even total innocents), anywhere, at anytime that gives the figure his label. 
 edward zwick 's the siege explores the possibility of this kind of violence taking place right here in the united states. 
 you 'd think the opening bit was ripped right from the headlines. 
 arab terrorists kill american citizens abroad, and the u. s. responds by retaliating against the sheik whom supposedly ordered the attack. 
 however, unlike the real- life tomahawk cruise missile strike against bin laden 's camp and manufacturing facility, the film version depicts special operations troops kidnapping sheik ahmed bin talal. 
 in retaliation, the terrorists bring the fight to the new world. 
 unwittingly involved is fbi assistant special agent- in- charge anthony hubbard( denzel washington), who works out of the bureau 's new york office at one federal plaza. 
 while investigating a series of bombings in the big apple, he encounters cia agent elise kraft( annette bening), also trying to uncover information. 
 generally, the fbi is charged with problems inside the u. s., while the cia takes care of problems in the international realm. 
 even spies from other countries are off limits to the cia as long as they are in our country. 
 hubbard therefore finds it highly unusual that an agency spook is nosing around what he considers his territory, but as the two form a tentative professional relationship, hubbard becomes more and more aware of an increasingly complicated series of allegiances and possibly illegal actions involving terrorism and the united states government.

"let me start off by saying that leading up to the release of the latest bond film, i really was n't looking forward to it as much as i have with some of the previous films. 
 i 'm not sure if it was the fairly lackluster trailers or the ever- present dread that the next film will fall back into the miserable ways of the timothy dalton years. 
 i 'm happy to report that any doubts were erased after about the first 10 minutes of the film. 
 by that point, it was evident that mr. 
 bond was back with a vengeance. 
 all doubts would have probably been erased sooner except for the fact that the first ten minutes of the film were n't exactly a pleasant experience. 
 it seems that nobody told the geniuses working at the theater that the house lights are supposed to be turned off when the movie starts. 
 it took a reminder from an audience member to clue them in. 
 i guess they can be excused though, taking tickets and cleaning up popcorn between shows is extremely taxing on the brain. 
 anyway, after somebody remembered what the light switch was for, i settled in for bond. 
 i think the most noticeable aspect of this, the 19th film in the series, is that it really goes back to the almost tongue in cheek style of the roger moore films.

[ theater rating: 
** 1/2: okay seats, sound, and picture] modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before, from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes. 
 the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it. 
"" 
 your friends and neighbors"" takes a different approach as it 's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends. 
 one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/ director neil labute 's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story. 
 firstly, and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex, detailed story of lust, betrayal, arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and just plain stupidity between six different characters( three men, three women), without hardly any supporting characters,( a few have a line or two), mostly extras. 
 everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full- circle back to themselves, whether it be positive or negative. 
 but to just state 
 this is arbitrary, and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult. 
 labute 's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat, but what 's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll. 
 for the sake of this review, i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic.

"some movies have such an impact that they linger in your mind long after the credits have rolled, making you think carefully and recollect on what you have just seen. 
 i finished mike figgis'"" leaving las vegas"" hours ago, and it is still as haunting as when i hit rewind on the vcr. 
 alot of people refer to this film as"" that flick where nick cage plays that alcoholic dude"". 
"" leaving las vegas"" is not so much a movie about alcoholism as it is a story about two people who except each other for what they are: a drunk and a whore. 
 ben( nicolas cage in possibly the best male performance of the past twenty years) is the drunk. 
 his family and friends have long since abandon him, and all he has left is his liquor. 
 in a scene early in the film, we see ben staggering into a resteraunt, looking for a"" friend"" of his to mooch some money off of. 
 he finds the guy( richard lewis) having dinner with a buddy and two chicks, trying to crack witty jokes that just come out stupid. 
 when ben approaches the table, you can clearly sense that everyone immediatly feels uncomfortable. 
 after lewis gives ben the money, he coldly says"" i think it would be best if you did n't contact me again.

 now even though through the course of the film, some much more depressing things happen, this is when i felt the most for ben.

 it turns out that ben was once a semi- successful hollywood player, and apparently a pretty popular guy.

" run lola run', a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival, is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance. 
 for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non- stop movement, we follow a fiery- haired heroine named lola( franka potente) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers. 
 lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100, 000 marks in time to save manni( moritz bleibtreu) from being killed by the dealer. 
 but, in something of a pseudo-` groundhog day' approach, director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal. 
 in these trio of episodes, we gradually learn the unique effects of fate, for even if tiny changes are made in lola 's journey, the future can be seriously altered. 
` run lola run' is an experience like` fight club' or` the matrix', in that each film takes you through a super- charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways. 
 in addition, all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack. 
` lola' is no exception, with stylish quick- flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get- go. 
 tykwer 's world is a landscape of mood and color, with brilliant shades of red and pink( including lola 's fiery hair) used as effective symbolism throughout. 
 with it 's visual style and mind- blowing pace,` run lola run' 
 is one of the more invigorating movies of the year. 
 even more so when considering the fact it 's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period. 
 as a heroine, potente does little more than run wildly through the streets( as the title suggests), but 
 she has a certain flair and charisma. 
 her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star.

"in"" the sweet hereafter,"" writer/ director atom egoyan takes us beyond the tragedy of death into the tragedy of living. 
 he shows us how it is n't dying that hurts, but rather 
 the pain of living in the hereafter of death, and dealing with the loss and grief that it brings. 
 on a cold winter day in a small, isolated town in british columbia, a school bus full of children slides off the highway and onto a frozen lake, where it cracks through the ice and sinks. 
 fourteen children die, and numerous others are hurt. 
 for the residents of this small town, all of whose children were on that bus, it is an earth- shattering event that resolutely alters their lives. 
 they have always relied on each other in the past to deal with heartache and pain, but it seems that this tragedy is more than they can handle. 
 alberta and risa walker, who own a local motel and lost their child in the accident, hire an attorney named mitchell stephens( ian holm) to bring a lawsuit against someone, anyone for responsibility. 
 the bus driver, dolores driscoll( gabrielle rose), is a kindly woman who loved the children and, although she lives with a burden of guilt, is not held responsible for the accident. 
 the bus seems to have simply slipped on some ice, and there was nothing should could do to prevent it. 
 however, according to stephens, there are no"" accidents"" in life, and someone will pay for this tragedy, whether that be the manufacturer of the bus or the guardrail the bus broke through.

"when i first heard about scream in 1996, i was told that it was a spoof of horror movies. 
 from the master of the horror himself, wes craven, it ridiculed the cliches of the genre by overemphasizing them, by making the teenagers do what they know they 're not supposed to do when a serial killer is stalking them( do n't run up the stairs when you can easily go out the front door, never say"" i 'll be right back,"" etc.). 
 when i first heard this description, i figured that it was an easy way out of making a bad movie. 
 how hard is it to make an extremely terrible film but claim it is actually a mockery of other bad movies. 
 was this wes craven 's remedy from making"" real"" bad movies such as vampires in brooklyn? 
 it just seemed cheap to me. 
 then i actually saw the movie and the first twenty minutes, involving drew barrymore and a nail- bitingly intense phone conversation, completely changed my attitude. 
 scream is not only a clever parody of your standard horror flick, it 's also a pretty scary movie. 
 if you 've seen a million of these kinds of films, you know exactly what is going to happen. 
 this is part of the fun of watching scream. 
 the movie reminds avid horror fans how similar and repetitive the genre is and it also reminds them how great a guilty pleasure it can be to watch pointless and predictable violence to innocent, attractive teenagers. to those who rarely see these types of movies, scream is a thrilling unpredictable ride that could be mistaken as a serious slasher film. 
 there 's nothing wrong with that misjudgment though. 
 i have witnessed viewers from both sides of the audience, the newbies to horror and the fanatics.

 yes. 
 this star wars prequel may be the worst of the bunch, with amateurish dialogue and an overall lack of humanity.

"bob the happy bastard 's quickie review: i must admit, no doubt 's single"" new"" is quite catchy. 
 it was bouncy and energetic enough to get me to go see this new film from director doug limon, the man who had brought us the humorous swingers a little while back. 
 the result? 
 a movie that 's just as good 
 as that song, really. 
 it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend. 
 first we hear about a grocery bagger( sara polley) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave( with bad results, as a drug dealer feels he 's been swindled by her) 
; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker( same store) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends, where sex, gunplay, and stolen car trouble come into play; then we see the story of two gay movie actors( played by scott wolf and jay mohr) who deal with a cop 's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl( sara) with their car; and, finally, we come to another grocery worker( katie holmes) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer( the one mentioned earlier). 
 really, it 's all confusing to keep track of in review format 
, your best bet is to just, well, go. 
 the movie features some very good acting from all angles, and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product. 
 the dialogue is pretty snappy and the resolution is pretty well realized, not going for the sappy happy ending nor the dreaded bad ending. 
 think of it as a, well, ending. 
 the intertwining of stories is a particularly good element to the movie, as it 's never really confusing and tells different sides of the story, like sliding doors kinda did.

"while watching"" shallow grave,"" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens'"" blood simple. 
"" 
 both are good films in which several characters, none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil, indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes. 
 the body count rises, and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands. 
 both films are also flawed, but for different reasons. 
"" 
 blood simple"" is unrelentingly dark and moody, but its characterizations were a little hollow. 
"" shallow grave,"" on the other hand, is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes, and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they 'd accomplished for a more standard, audience- pleasing ending. 
 the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time, yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end. 
 as the film begins, we are introduced to alex( ewan mcgregor), juliet( kerry fox), and david( christopher eccleston), a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow. 
 they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious, but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch. 
 a man named hugo moves into the apartment 's remaining vacancy, and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose.

 that takes us completely off guard, and instead of a straight- forward, hollywood- ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed,"" beloved"" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened( or, rather, toni morrison, who wrote the novel upon which this is based). 
"" beloved"" tells the story of an ex- slave named sethe, played by oprah winfrey, who lives on a large farm in the north with her children. 
 when the film opens, her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist, which shakes things up, wounds the dog, and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family.

"" 
( actually, it 's"" lock and load""), you ca n't help thinking tarantino. 
 and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery, the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie& clyde to natural born killers. 
 but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run, normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon. 
"" inspired by true events"" -- we 've heard that one before, and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated... 
 or so strangely poignant. 
 for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality, who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged. 
 beginning with their final arrest, the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris( luke perry), a policeman, and pam( ashley judd), a factory worker. 
 they fall in love and marry, but pam 's increasingly erratic behaviour( going on spending sprees, slashing herself with a knife after an argument) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris. 
 when chris gets sacked, they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up. 
 then, chris begins to rob banks... 
 luke perry accomplishes the not- inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer.

 loses a leg and a good friend when an early morning ride climaxes with their horses colliding with a semi. 
 grace 's horse survived, but barely, and has gone mad. 
 annie refuses to put the animal out of his misery, believing that if the horse heals it will mend grace 's newly- broken spirit.

 as part of his alliance with france, he requests the hand- in- marriage to the queen of normandy( joan sims). 
 she comes to england in the hope of marrying henry 
 but when he finds out that she loves garlic and has a reeking garlic breath, he is totally averse to the idea of marriage. 
 henry 's court is very corrupt, with the cardinal( terry scott) trying to bribe cromwell( kenneth williams) and cromwell trying to bribe the king. 
 there is a state of crisis when the king puts marie the queen( sims) in the tower of london ready for execution. 
 the queen is pregnant but she has not liased with the king before, so fingers are pointed at sir roger de lodgerley played by charles hawtrey, who has a rather lecherous character to play this time. 
 the cardinal and cromwell decide to get a signed confession from sir roger by using all kinds of torture devices! 
 owing to circumstances, sir roger is sometimes needed to sign that he is the father and 
 sometimes that he is n't. 
 this is because of renewed threats by the king of france( peter gilmore) to come over himself, which in the end he does. 
 by then, henry has found himself a new queen, played by none other than barbara windsor! 
 it looks like he has some explaining to do!

"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task: they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare 's works. 
 they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare: i mean, really, who does n't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter? 
 stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare, and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare. 
 and, despite the difficulty of their task, they have succeeded. 
 shakespeare in love is one of the smartest, funniest, most touching films of the year. 
 it 's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors 
, 
 but here we have a movie that defines success: it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written. 
 it could have been a smug, self- important movie that panders to die- hard shakespeare fans, but the appeal of this film is almost universal: 
 if you 've ever read a play by shakespeare, or know anything about his life, it 's likely that you 'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love. 
 joseph fiennes, brother of ralph, stars as shakespeare himself 
; he 's a delightful, irresistible lad, concerned mostly with women and detached from life 's more serious problems( debt, plague, etc.). 
 he 's commissioned to write plays for various people: queen elizabeth( judi dench) wants comedies, while local slimeball philip henslowe( geoffrey rush) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann( tom wilkinson). 
 shakespeare, however, has trouble focusing on his work.

"titantic, writer and director james cameron 's much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed$ 200, 000, 000 epic, arrives shortly into the theaters 
 so the question naturally arises, whether the film is worth it? 
 as a business proposition, it seems hard to see how it can ever break even, but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful. if you 've already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure, think again. 
 the movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world 's most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers. 
 in either case, it is filmmaking at its best. 
 when we entered the press screening, my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long. 
 he said no 
 but that the time would go by so fast she 'd never notice the length. 
 amazingly, he was right. 
 titanic is one of the few long films that does n't suffer because of it. 
 the lush picture, filmed by russell carpenter in 70 mm, opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean. 
 fortune hunter brock lovett( bill paxton) leads the expedition looking for the world 's most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship, known back then as"" the ship of dreams.

 the necklace 's hundred- year- old former owner, rose dewitt bukater( gloria stuart), finds brock to tell him her story. 
 although almost all of the movie happens in flashback, one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk.

"the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and"" real"" movies. 
 consider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste. 
 top- flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power 
 whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety. 
 based on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks, the movie represents a rethinking of the story 's structure, not merely a literal adaptation of the novel. 
 told in linear form by four narrators in the book, egoyan 's version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator. 
 the author is even on record as applauding egoyan 's changes. 
 in the press notes the book 's author describes the story as"" a parable of lost children. 
"" 
 he says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children. 
 picking up on this, egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter, nicole burnell, played with grace by sarah polley, reads parts of"" the pied piper"" from an old, illustrated book to her two charges. 
 periodically throughout the picture, nicole 's readings are heard in voice- over. 
 you have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment. 
 they and the rest of the town 's children come into harm 's way -- 
 some live and others are seriously injured. 
 and the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again. 
 although the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children, the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss.

" warning to those who have not seen seven: this review contains some spoiler information.) 
 seven is a powerful, fully- realized film on the level of the silence of the lambs. 
 it is a disturbing film that accomplishes its biggest of goals -- it occupies the viewers mind long after the closing credits have rolled. 
 while this film is not for the squeamish, there is no denying that seven demands attention, for it is a film that transcends its genre in both style and substance. 
 for starters, classifying seven as a"" thriller"" would not be an altogether complete classification of this film. 
 while i was genuinely thrilled throughout, i would rather call seven an"" intense drama,"" because that is what it delivers -- meaningful scenes with a relentlessness that does not readily let up. 
 part of director david finchers accomplishment is in style. 
 he seems to have a knack for knowing exactly how the average person fears something as"" simple"" as a corpse. 
 and visually, fincher shows us the remains of murder victims in all- too- realistic and graphic terms( courtesy of rob bottin 's always- grisly special effects). 
 throw in the appropriate but not- to- be- underestimated effects of lighting and a foreboding score and the result is a technical masterpiece of the murder scene. 
 these scenes alone are quite impressive; as fascinating as they are harrowing. 
 yet, seven is more than just a technical accomplishment. 
 in addition to style, fincher supplies substance. 
 seven has compelling characters that it wants us to know and understand, and fincher ties them all together in a completely pessimistic view of society. 
 detective william somerset( morgan freeman) is a man who has nearly given up on the world. 
 its easy to see why.

"modern audiences are more likely to be familiar with les misirables from the pop- broadway musical rather than victor hugo 's original tome. 
 adapted several times for the cinema, this latest effort 
 does a superb job of translating the characters, story, and heart of the novel to the screen. 
 liam neeson stars as jean valjean. 
 as a young man, valjean stole some bread to satisfy his hunger... 
 and he was sentenced to 19 years of hard labor for his crimes. 
 prison hardened him, and on his release he seems doomed to a life of crime and squalor. 
 however, an unexpected act of compassion changes his outlook on life, and he vows to become a better man. 
 however, he runs up against one man who does n't believe in reform. 
 inspector javert( geoffrey rush) is an obsessive law abider. 
 he has no tolerance for anyone who breaks the rules, even with benign intentions. 
 he once served as a guard at the labor camp where valjean served, and after valjean breaks his parole, javert devotes himself to bringing him to justice. 
 two women also get caught up in the struggle.

 i mention this only because i thinks its important to state up front that i 'm not against pornogrpahy. 
 i 've seen enough of these films to know the range of content and quality available. 
 director paul thomas anderson 's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema, the mid to late 70s. 
 this was the period when x- rated movies were real movies, shot on film, shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics. 
 this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films, films that attempted to tell a real story. 
 one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how, like in an any other billion dollar industry, the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete. 
 in this case, the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette. 
 burt reynold 's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur, known as jack horner. 
 horner 's has a steady"" family"" of performers, some of whom live in his plush l. a. home. 
 but in the world of porn, performers are a commodity- the fresher, the better. 
 when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque, he decides to add him to his stable. 
 it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his. as directed by anderson, the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door.

 it 's hard to dislike a movie that uses such skill with it 's manipulation. 
 in addition, it 's also a terrific family film. 
 this is the true story of violin teacher 
 roberta guaspari, who fought the school board to keep the musical program active in a handful of inner city harlem schools. 
 it could also be described as` mrs. 
 streep 's opus'. 
 yes, meryl streep brings her dramatic clout to the demanding role of guaspari, and that brings both good news and bad. 
 out of the gate, possibly because of her distracting star power and the rushed writing, it is relatively difficult to identify with roberta 's character and grasp her academic point- of- view. 
 she is very strict with her students, but what insight does that create into the story? 
 slowly but surely, we begin to recognize the intentions of the character, and show admiration for the thoughtfulness and human feeling that streep has once again applied. 
 one thoroughly interesting fact about` music of the heart' lies with the unlikely presence in the director 's chair: horror veteran wes craven. 
 after leaving an impression with the` scream' films and the original` nightmare on elm street', craven has attempted a precarious cross- over to drama.

"here 's a word analogy: amistad is to the lost world as schindler 's list is to jurassic park. in 1993, after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit, many critics described schindler 's list as the director 's"" penance""( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd- pleasing blockbuster). 
 now, after a three- year layoff, spielberg is back with a vengeance. 
 once again, his summer release was special effects- loaded action/ adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers. 
 now, following his 1993 pattern, he has fashioned another serious, inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity. 
 that film is amistad. 
 although not as masterful as schindler 's list, amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture. thematically rich, impeccably crafted, and intellectually stimulating, the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact. 
 watching schindler 's list was a powerful, almost spiritual, experience. 
 spielberg pulled us into the narrative, absorbed us in the drama, then finally let us go, exhausted and shattered, three- plus hours later. 
 aspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since. 
 amistad, while 
 a fine example of film making, is not as transcendent. 
 the incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books, but, considering who writes the texts, that 's not a surprise. 
 however, the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric, and, while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account, most of the basic facts are in order. 
 several, mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film 's dramatic force.

 thanks in part to delicious characterization and an all- encompassing sense of humor, the film is a smashing success. 
 the central oddball here is the dude( jeff bridges), an unemployed cad whose ambitions appear to be zilch beyond smoking pot, drinking beer and going bowling( are you college students already rooting for him, or what?). 
 one night, a pair of thugs break into his house and pee on his carpet, 
 a threatening act that 's supposed to be carried out against a famous pasadena millionaire( david huddleston) who shares his birth name -- jeff lebowski -- with the dude. 
 once the dude realizes this coincidence, he visits the big lebowski in hopes to claim reparations for his soiled rug, and is back to his normal life with alley pals walter( john goodman), a hotheaded vietnam vet, and donny( buscemi), a mild- mannered surfer, before too long. 
 soon, though, lebowski 's trampy trophy wife bunny( tara reid) is kidnaped and held for a hefty ransom, and he turns to the dude for help. 
 it seems bunny 's troubles are related to a line of work she 's kept secret from her husband -- she 's actually an adult film star and is very in debt with a shady producer named jackie treehorn.

 here', of course, was still three months away. 
 i 'll admit, when i trotted off to see this film, the only john woo movie i had seen before was the fairly enjoyable but highly forgetable broken arrow. 
 i 'd heard good things about his previous work with movies like hard boiled, but his films were definitely not on my must- see list. 
 that, let me tell you, has changed completely. 
 i knew this fact only five minutes into the film, after the brilliantly shot and acted opening sequence where sean archer loses his son blew me off my feet. 
 the acting throughout the film is staggeringly good for an action flick.

 to celebrate its 20th anniversary, this quintessential movie musical is getting the royal treatment reserved for classics like"" star wars"" -- a well- deserved, red- carpet rerelease.

 a very skinny john travolta and a very young olivia newton- john have the respective leads of danny zuko and sandy olsson, and their pairing still ranks as one of screendom 's most effervescently charming. 
 for those eight of you who are n't familiar with the story, here 's a brief recap: greaser bad boy danny and aussie good girl sandy are reunited for their 1959 senior year at rydell high after a brief fling during the summer; both thought she was going to return to her native continent before school started, but both were wrong. 
 sandy tries to rekindle their relationship, but danny 's too cool a cat to fall for her wholesome appeal in front of his t- bird buddies( including jeff conaway). 
 so sandy hooks up with a gang herself -- the pink ladies, headed by sassy, sexy rizzo( stockard channing, just superb as an independent woman well ahead of her time) -- and danny, who still really feels love for her, attempts a compromise of ideals in order to win her back.

"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you, at times, cracking up. 
 the film takes place, for the most part, in real- time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood. 
 hrundi v. 
 bakshi, played very well by peter sellers, is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland, india. 
 hrundi tries out his acting talents, but it seems that he just is n't cut out for the job. 
 on the set of his current film that he stars in, hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse. 
 during the filming of this movie set in the 1800 's, hrundi manages to annoy the director( herbert ellis) in any way he can. this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes, wearing an underwater watch in one scene, and accidentally detonating a massive set. 
 many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever. 
 and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr. 
 clutterbuck( j. edward mckinley) 
 pleading for hrundi 's ejection from hollywood, everything is pretty much over for hrundi. 
 clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood. 
 but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck 's exclusive party, hrundi is invited, and certain chaos is bound to occur. 
 of course, as predicted, hrundi causes lots of trouble. 
 each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation, usually one that he ca n't handle, is almost always very humorous. 
 and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter, who is alone hilarious

 the future zwick and screenwriter lawrence wright offer is all too possible.

 as youngsters, brian finn, jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio. 
 while their friendship progressed, anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support, so neither would feel excluded. but tragedy soon struck, as anna was forced to move away.

"anna and the king strides onto the screen in full regalia, wearing a brilliant suit of sumptuous landscapes, deep, vibrant colors and an epic storyline. 
 it 's true beauty comes from it 's subtle ruminations on the politics of power, whether it 's between governments, or the interplay between a man and a woman. 
 anna( jodie foster) is a widowed british schoolteacher with a touch of wanderlust trying to grasp her quicksilver feelings concerning the recent death of her husband. 
 with son in tow, she takes the employ of king mongkut( chow yun- fat) to tutor his son in the english language. 
 mongkut sees the strength of the british and correctly surmises that his country 's future lies in opening itself up to the ways of the western world. 
 anna function is to help provide that link. 
 the core of the film, of course, deals with the blossoming love between anna and mongkut as it attempts to germinate in the unfriendly soil of a shifting political climate. 
 foster plays anna with equal parts clenched jaw and wide- eyed wonder. 
 she is assertive, yet, respectful of the king as she initially tries to impose her western sensibilities upon him. 
 it is one of foster 's strongest performances since silence of the lambs in a role she could not have played earlier in her career. 
 she brings a mature self- awareness and determination that might not have come across from a younger foster. 
 it 's a joy to watch her cagily bargain for her own measure of influence within the realm of mongkut 's monarchy. 
 when she makes her entrance into a politically charged banquet mid- film, she exudes a hypnotic beauty that is deepened by her textured performance. 
 chow- yun fat 's king mongkut is every measure of foster 's anna, perhaps even more so. 
 this is the chow yun- fat that hong kong cinema has been in love with for nearly twenty years. 
 he is imposing, yet vulnerable, playful, but stern.

"scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well. 
 during a film- class discussion, windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are, and why sequels never live up to the originals. 
 a few rare exceptions are noted, but they left out one... 
 scream 2! 
 1996 's surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america! 
 a sequel was unavoidable, but luckily the re- teaming of writer kevin williamson and director 
 wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment. 
 in fact, at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream, i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film! 
 sidney prescott( neve campbell), the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro, ca in the original scream, is now two years older and off to college, majoring in theater. 
 meanwhile, tv journalist gale weathers( courtney cox), who covered the murders in the first film, has since written a book about the dreadful events; a book titled"" stab"", which has been developed into a major motion picture. 
 as scream 2 opens, a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of"" stab"", and before long, a young couple are butchered to death, unnoticed in the midst of hysteria. 
 this marks 
 the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown"" copycat"" sets out to repeat what 's been done... and finish what has n't!

"devotees of robert a. heinlein, be forewarned: paul verhoeven 's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein 's novel than it is a literary satire. 
 the author 's jingo- all- the- way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless, faceless parade of carnage from the film version. 
 and i suppose that 's exactly what verhoeven delivers, with sometimes hilarious results. 
 heinlein 's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement, while their strengths become the stuff of high- energy entertainment. 
 outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor, since it 's basically a big bug hunt... 
 aliens in broad daylight. 
 sometime in the future, humanity is threatened by giant, malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty- foot- tall action figures( arachnids with super- impaling spikes, beetles that spew forth lava, dragonflies with guillotine legs). 
 among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires: conflicted rich kid johnny rico( casper van dien); his math whiz girlfriend carmen( denise richards); dizzy( dina meyer), who secretly carries a torch for johnny; and carl( neil patrick"" doogie howser"" harris), who not- so- secretly carries a torch for dizzy, and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets.

"the"" italian hitchcock"" and acknowledged master of the giallo murder- mystery dario argento again offers us a fascinating turn on the formula in pheneomena. 
 this time the twist comes in the form of jennifer corvino( jennifer connelly), a bright teenager with gift for telepathically communicating with insects. 
 sent to a girls boarding school in switzerland, she soon learns of a series of bizarre disappearances and at least one murder that has the school 's population terrified. 
 a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist( donald pleasance) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift. 
 phenomena is an imaginative, original thriller. 
 writer/ director argento creates several sequences of surreal, haunting beauty here, including a masterfully shot sleepwalking episode and a striking scene when a swarm of flying insects descends on the school at jennifer 's beckoning. 
 the plot takes some wonderfully bizarre turns and the killer 's identity is genuinely shocking and surprising. 
 the director took a big gamble with a soundtrack that mixes elements as diverse as heavy metal band iron maiden, ex- rolling stone bill wyman, and argento 's favourite gothic/ electronic outfit goblin.

 it gels surprisingly well. 
 the film 's opening music reccurs several times, an eerie and evocative score that perfectly sets the overall tone.

 the movie presents us with the results of that heavy drug use. 
 critique: i have given this movie two separate ratings because i believe that the enjoyment of this psychedelic picture is highly correlated with the amount of drugs or alcohol that would be floating around in the viewer 's own mind, whilst inhaling this cinematic vision of excess.

 how does one determine who is free? 
 in 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now. 
 yet, the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations. 
 that is, in essence, what steven spielberg 's gripping drama"" amistad"" is about. 
 through its various dramas, spielberg presents a case about a group of africans, who, after being seized from their home, were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard"" la amistad"". 
 on their way there, the slaves, led by cinque( djimon hounsou), rebelled, killing off part of the crew. 
 however, the ship was still directed towards the united states, where the africans were brought to trial under murder. 
 in the court, various factions claim ownership of the slaves, and therefore try to seize them away. 
 the united states government, led by president martin van buren( nigel hawthorne), and secretary of state secretary forsyth( david paymer), try to ship the africans to spain, where an 11 year old isabella ii( anna paquin) wants them back. 
 the two spaniards who own"" la amistad"" want the slaves for themselves. 
 the american ship that found the slaves also wants them. 
 in the midst of this are two abolitionists( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman), who want the slaves to be free. 
 they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey, who tries to free them. 
 through various legal proceedings, the case appears before the supreme court, where it is argued by ex- president john quincy adams( anthony hopkins).

"in october of 1962 the united states found itself on the brink of nuclear holocaust when u2 spy plane fly- overs of cuba revealed that the soviet union was actively deploying and installing medium range ballistic missiles 90 miles from the us. 
 president john kennedy( bruce greenwood) and 
 his staff must face this major threat to world peace and stop soviet expansionism in director roger donaldson 's dramatic recreation of the most dangerous crisis in american history in"" thirteen days. 
"" 
 one of the highlights to come out of made- for- tv movies was a 1974 entry called"" missiles of october"" that also recreated the historic event that almost embroiled the us, ussr and the world in an all out nuclear showdown. 
 that teleplay, starring william devane and martin sheen as john and bobby, showed the political tensions of the period that brought to the fore the danger the world faced in those two weeks in 1962. 
 now, a quarter of a century after the landmark tv movie, director roger donaldson and producer kevin costner team together again( the last time was for the taught spy thriller"" no way out"") to re- enact the events of that most dangerous time in america 's and the world 's history. 
 taken from the viewpoint of special assistant to the president kenneth p. 
 o'donnell( costner), donaldson and crew recreate 
 that volatile event, once again, as the country is plunged into what could have been total nuclear war. 
 as o'donnell gets ready to head to work one october morning, he deals with the usual family crises and problems.

"true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head- on, which is probably why so few of them do it. 
 even the most religious directors- like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman- usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms. 
 so it 's not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get"" the apostle"" onto the big- screen. 
 as a matter of fact, even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing, and he ended up paying for it with$ 5 million of his own money. 
 he also wrote the script, directed the film, and starred as the central character, a fiery texas preacher named euliss"" sonny"" dewey. 
 few filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial, technical, and creative responsibility single- handedly, and it 's testament to 
 what an intensely personal project this was for duvall. 
 and, thankfully, every bit of that personal investment translates on- screen into power and honest emotion. 
 sonny is an energetic, pentecostal preacher who has been speaking( actually shouting) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve. 
 he spends much of his time traveling about the country, evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals. 
 unlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers, sonny is not a phony or a swindler, and the film 's purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church. 
 duvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says, although like all humans, he has weaknesses. 
 one of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that, not only does his long- suffering wife, jessie( farrah fawcett), want to leave him for another man in the congregation, but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher.

"i want to correct what i wrote last year in my retrospective of david lean 's war picture. 
 i still think that"" the bridge on the river kwai"" does n't deserve being the number 13 in the american film institute 's list of the 100 greatest american movies. 
 and i think that"" 12 angry men"","" witness for the prosecution"" and"" paths of glory"" would have been better choices for the oscar for the best picture of 1957. 
 but i ca n't deny the importance of"" the bridge on the river kwai""- cinematically and in its contents. 
 the film is set in burma in 1943. 
 a batallion of british soldiers in japanese war captivity is forced by the japanese to build a strategically momentous railway bridge over the river kwai.

"recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville- one from entertainment weekly, one from a newsgroup, and two from different online resources. 
 each review compared this film to the truman show. 
 why? 
 the only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television. 
 other than that, the two movies are completely different from each other. 
 reviewers seem to love to pick one movie( i. 
 e. 
 the truman show), obsess over it, and make it a guideline for other movies. 
 when pleasantville and edtv opened, all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman. 
 the same goes for the thin red line, as well. 
 when it opened in decemeber, probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg 's saving private ryan, giving thin line no chance whatsoever. 
 critics loved private ryan so much, that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards. 
 this is why i think pleasantville was underrated. if the truman show had never been made, pleasantville probably would have received better reviews, done better at the box office, and would be remembered after it 's long been on the video store shelves. 
 sure, it was n't perfect, and it was n't very believeable, but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars, and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history. 
 with the exception of don knotts as the annoying"" tv repairman"" the film is cast perfectly: the ice storm 's tobey maguire is david in real life; he watches the old 50 's sitcom"" pleasantville"" to escape from his feuding parents. 
 his twin sister, jen( reese witherspoon) is a popular slut who( steriotypically) smokes and wears revealing clothes.

 the teaser trailers for my best friend 's wedding scarsely gave reason for hope- it looked like the sort of goofy, light- hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight, but little more; i 'd frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often. 
 it was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend 's wedding was such a success- a strong, bouyant romantic- comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects, featuring a triumphant performance from ms.

 the heroine of my best friend 's wedding is julianne potter( julia roberts), a successful new york restaurant critic, and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes( rupert everett) that years ago, she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex- lover michael o'neal( dermot mulroney), a sports writer, that if they both had n't married by the time they reached 28, they had promised to marry each other.

"david lynch 's"" blue velvet"" begins and ends with colorful, bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town. 
 however, what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a"" strange world"" of drug dealers, sadists, and murderers. 
 the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy, disturbing film. 
 they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances. 
 odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film, its characters, its direction, and its story. 
 thankfully, the obscurity that"" blue velvet"" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable. since its elements are so originally weird, you never know what will happen next. 
 this is the main goal of a movie; to be spontaneous and surprising. 
"" blue velvet"" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting. 
 lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling. 
 the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy( kyle maclachlan). 
 from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer( isabella rossellinia) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping. 
 the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch 's story telling so amazing. 
 maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship, in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick, and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends. 
 through these multiple stories, maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan, we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots. 
 lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion. 
 instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times.

 the classic neil simon comedy( based on his own stage play) about suicidal felix( lemmon), who is persuaded by his poker friend oscar( matthau) to stay with him in his apartment after felix 's wife throws him out and files for divorce. 
 the hook: oscar is messy and likes his apartment that way, while felix is an obsessive/ compulsive neat freak. 
 the two men, despite their friendship, instantly clash. 
 movies just are n't as delightfully funny as this one is. 
 every line of neil simon 's dialogue flows like comedic poetry, and all the actors are just perfect in their performances. 
 lemmon 
 is at his best as the anxiety ridden felix, but it 's matthau who shines brightest as oscar, whose world is being invaded and rearranged, mostly against his wishes( the type of character i always enjoy identifying with).

 at night they pursue their life- long ambition to loose their virginity in failed attempts to get into the roxbury in beverly hills, ca, the only disco act worth going to. 
 the only problem, the place is so popular and the waiting line so long that by the time the brothers make it to the front door, the roxbury closes, all the while bearing witness to guys with one- hundred- dollar bills and movie stars like richard grieco who get past the doorman without fuss. 
 the script authors( steve koren, will ferrell and chris kattan) cleverly devised a way for our boys to get into the roxbury.

 dad 's subtle racism grew large in derek, after gang members killed his father.

 now derek keeps his head shaved and has a giant swastika tattooed over his heart. 
 derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence. 
 at a basketball court, black and white tempers flare. 
 derek channels the aggression into a game, black versus white, for ownership of the courts. 
 when the choice presents itself, derek goes for game point instead of the sucker- punch. 
 cameron( stacy keach) steps in to derek 's life as a surrogate father. 
 he takes derek under his wing and nurtures his racist feelings. 
 keeping his own criminal record spotless, he uses derek as a leader and organizer for high- visibility racial intimidation. 
 derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race- motivated mob crimes. 
 at the bottom of the chain, derek 's younger brother danny( edward furlong, made famous in terminator 2) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons, but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong.

"john von neumann, progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project, pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos, even without recourse to faster- than light travel. 
 you send out self- replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information. 
 it may take decades, centuries, or millennia, but it can be done with achievable technology, and does n't require a magical faster- than- light drive. in the fifties, british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer, which would then engage in a real- time dialog with the aliens, exchanging information and technologies, and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned. 
 about thirty- five years ago, the bbc contracted with astronomer/ writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini- series called a for andromeda. 
 afa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission, the construction of a huge computer, the computer 's analysis of life on earth, and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication.

"the central focus of michael winterbottom 's"" welcome to sarajevo"" is sarajevo itself, the city under siege, and its different effect on the characters unfortunate enough to be stuck there.

 the question is what went wrong. 
 for one, the film fails to provide a political overview of the war as it progresses( the dillane characters reports an american plane departing from sarajevo as it departs, and that 's about it.). 
 the assortment of high- profile supporting actors, ranging from woody harrelson as a yankee reporter"" into"" liquor and cigarrettes to marisa tomei as a huggable children 's aid or somesuch are incapable of rising above the sketchiness of their characters, albeit they strive. 
 the interrupted use of authentic war footage somewhat hampers the rest of the film, it makes the fictional characters seem powerless by comparison. 
 still, winterbottom eschews mawkishness through flashy, frantic editing and imaginative use of music.
