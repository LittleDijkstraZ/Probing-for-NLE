"The movie is a teen mind-fuck that presents a cool idea in a bad package. It's too jumbled and confusing, with too many unexplained weird things happening. Despite a cool ending, it's not entertaining or engaging, and feels redundant for most of its runtime. It's not a horror or teen slasher flick, but it's packaged to look that way.",negative,"[[[0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0], [-8.673617379884035e-19, -1.0408340855860843e-17], [-8.673617379884035e-19, -1.0408340855860843e-17], [-8.673617379884035e-19, -1.0408340855860843e-17], [-8.673617379884035e-19, -1.0408340855860843e-17], [-0.0228125, 0.0228125], [-0.0228125, 0.0228125], [-0.04520833333333333, 0.04520833333333332], [-0.04520833333333333, 0.04520833333333332], [-0.04520833333333333, 0.04520833333333332], [-0.018750000000000017, 0.01875], [-0.0029411764705882314, 0.002941176470588235], [-0.0029411764705882314, 0.002941176470588235], [-0.015441176470588232, 0.01544117647058823], [-0.015441176470588232, 0.01544117647058823], [-0.027941176470588233, 0.027941176470588226], [-0.0029411764705882314, 0.002941176470588235], [-0.04669117647058824, 0.046691176470588215], [-0.009191176470588223, 0.009191176470588234], [-0.021691176470588235, 0.021691176470588224], [-0.03419117647058823, 0.034191176470588225], [-0.027941176470588233, 0.027941176470588226], [-0.027941176470588233, 0.027941176470588226], [-0.002941176470588232, 0.0029411764705882344], [-0.002941176470588232, 0.0029411764705882344], [-0.002941176470588232, 0.0029411764705882344], [-0.002941176470588232, 0.0029411764705882344], [-0.002941176470588232, 0.0029411764705882344], [0.0004166666666666652, -0.0004166666666666676], [0.0004166666666666652, -0.0004166666666666676], [0.0004166666666666652, -0.0004166666666666676], [0.0004166666666666652, -0.0004166666666666676], [0.0004166666666666652, -0.0004166666666666676], [-0.008333333333333326, 0.008333333333333331], [-0.008333333333333326, 0.008333333333333331], [-0.023958333333333328, 0.023958333333333328], [-0.023958333333333328, 0.023958333333333328], [-0.042708333333333334, 0.04270833333333333], [-0.00989583333333333, 0.00989583333333333], [-0.00989583333333333, 0.00989583333333333], [-0.0062499999999999865, 0.006249999999999985], [-0.03593750000000001, 0.03593749999999998], [-0.03593750000000001, 0.03593749999999998], [-0.010937499999999998, 0.010937499999999992], [-0.010937499999999998, 0.010937499999999992], [-0.0031249999999999945, 0.003125000000000005], [-0.0031249999999999945, 0.003125000000000005], [-0.0031249999999999945, 0.003125000000000005], [-0.015624999999999993, 0.015625000000000007], [-0.005530303030303038, 0.005530303030303029], [-0.005530303030303038, 0.005530303030303029], [-0.003446969696969704, 0.003446969696969696], [-0.003446969696969704, 0.003446969696969696], [-0.003446969696969704, 0.003446969696969696], [-0.0017803030303030279, 0.0017803030303030305], [0.00019886363636362637, -0.00019886363636363764], [0.00019886363636362637, -0.00019886363636363764], [0.00019886363636362637, -0.00019886363636363764], [0.00019886363636362637, -0.00019886363636363764], [-0.02636363636363636, 0.02636363636363636], [-0.016111111111111125, 0.016111111111111104], [-0.002048611111111117, 0.00204861111111111], [-0.002048611111111117, 0.00204861111111111], [-0.002048611111111117, 0.00204861111111111], [-0.002048611111111117, 0.00204861111111111], [-0.0036111111111111175, 0.0036111111111111096], [-0.0036111111111111175, 0.0036111111111111096], [-0.0036111111111111175, 0.0036111111111111096], [-0.016111111111111125, 0.016111111111111104]]]","[[[0.0, 0.0]]]","[[['The', '  movie', '  is', '  a', '  teen', '  mind', ' -f', ' uck', '  that', '  presents', '  a', '  cool', '  idea', '  in', '  a', '  bad', '  package', ' .', '  It', "" 's"", '  too', '  j', ' umbled', '  and', '  confusing', ' ,', '  with', '  too', '  many', '  un', ' explained', '  weird', '  things', '  happening', ' .', '  Despite', '  a', '  cool', '  ending', ' ,', '  it', "" 's"", '  not', '  entertaining', '  or', '  engaging', ' ,', '  and', '  feels', '  redundant', '  for', '  most', '  of', '  its', '  runtime', ' .', '  It', "" 's"", '  not', '  a', '  horror', '  or', '  teen', '  sl', ' asher', '  flick', ' ,', '  but', '  it', "" 's"", '  packaged', '  to', '  look', '  that', '  way', ' .']]]","[[[0.1, 0.9]]]","[""The review is mostly negative, with the reviewer criticizing the movie for being confusing, unengaging, and redundant.
