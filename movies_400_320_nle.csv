" 
 you ca n't have any of this. 
 it 's all mine!"" --- 
 a twisted priest( charles huevelman) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana( angela zimmerly) looks on uninterested. 
 an evil presence, appropriately named the presence( dj vivona), rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him. 
 for kicks, the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered. 
 when something goes wrong and one of the presence 's recent victims escapes, the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped. 
 they enlist the help of alison( ramona midgett), a recent suicide victim, to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether- realm. 
 her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was, an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed. 
 the king 's sorcerer, amblyn( who also lost his job), decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice. 
 during the downtime in his unemployment, amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery, evil, and torture ruled. 
 abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm, so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love. 
 in this new realm, amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm. 
 after each murder, abraham would become stronger, until his power surpassed that of amblyn 's. because of the screw- up that allowed the recent escape, abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself. 
 as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways, the six new hapless humans",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the plot of the movie as confusing and chaotic. The reviewer also mentions the systematic slaughter of characters and the lack of a clear explanation for the events in the movie.
"alexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft- played character of dashing swordsman d'artagnon in director peter hyam 's adventure"" the musketeer. 
"" for some reason that i may figure out later, i do n't know why the time, money and effort were put into the making of"" the musketeer. 
"" 
 it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this film 's xin- xin xiong("" once upon a time in china"") and yuen woo- ping from"" crouching tiger, hidden dragon. 
"" 
 the result is a mix of genres that do n't mesh well. 
 elements of the ritz brothers- style comedy( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939"" the three musketeers""), the man with no name from"" a fistful of dollars 
""( d'artagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano. 
 the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the"" matrix"" crowd. 
 alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters. 
 the real problem with the"" the musketeer"" lies in the casting of the two lead, romantically intertwined characters, d'artagnan and francesca( mena suvari). 
 chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character, a la chris o'donnell, but lacks any onscreen charisma 
. 
 suvari has the doe- eyed, pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen, but she, too, does not have the chemistry to command the screen. 
 if"" the musketeer"" makes them any money, they should invest in acting lessons. 
 stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one.

" run lola run', a german import that gained a stellar reputation at the sundance film festival, is a dazzling and kinetic film that deals with the subjects of fate and chance. 
 for a berserk and retroactive 81 minutes of non- stop movement, we follow a fiery- haired heroine named lola( franka potente) as she sprints to save her boyfriend from the clutches of drug dealers. 
 lola has roughly twenty minutes to somehow retrieve 100, 000 marks in time to save manni( moritz bleibtreu) from being killed by the dealer. 
 but, in something of a pseudo-` groundhog day' approach, director tom tykwer gives lola three separate chances to best navigate her way toward the goal. 
 in these trio of episodes, we gradually learn the unique effects of fate, for even if tiny changes are made in lola 's journey, the future can be seriously altered. 
` run lola run' is an experience like` fight club' or` the matrix', in that each film takes you through a super- charged wormhole of bending reality in surreal and exciting ways. 
 in addition, all three movies have a visual style that separates them from the rest of the pack. 
` lola' is no exception, with stylish quick- flash camera work and cinematography that serves as scintillating eye candy from the get- go. 
 tykwer 's world is a landscape of mood and color, with brilliant shades of red and pink( including lola 's fiery hair) used as effective symbolism throughout. 
 with it 's visual style and mind- blowing pace,` run lola run' 
 is one of the more invigorating movies of the year. 
 even more so when considering the fact it 's all stuffed rather nonchalantly into an 81-minute time period. 
 as a heroine, potente does little more than run wildly through the streets( as the title suggests), but 
 she has a certain flair and charisma. 
 her exemplary running form made me wonder if she is actually a track star. 
 meanwhile, bleibtreu does an equally fantastic",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the movie for its kinetic and dazzling style, its exploration of fate and chance, and its unique visual style. The reviewer also compliments the performances of the actors and the mind-blowing pace of the movie."
"except for a few bright moments of good verbal comedy, that old feeling is embarrassing to sit through. 
 bette midler and dennis farina play lilly and dan, actress and author, once married 
, now violently divorced, and back together one last time for their daughter molly 's( paula marshall) wedding. 
 lilly and dan hate each other passionately -- so passionately that they have sex at the wedding and fall in love again. 
 each ditches his or her current spouse of 14 years and runs off with the other. 
 molly, married now only 24 hours, runs off in search of her irresponsible parents while her husband keith( jamie denton) tries to console the abandoned spouses. 
 in molly 's search for her parents, she somehow falls in love with lilly 's paparazzo joey( danny nucci). 
 meanwhile, the newlywed keith ends up consoling dan 's wife rowena( gail o'grady) in bed. 
 the audience i saw this with apparently thought that all the adultery was hilarious. 
 i 'm no dan quayle, but i thought it was a bit creepy 
. 
 the message seemed to be"" ignore your responsibilities unrepentantly and have fun fucking who you wish. 
"""" family values"" aside, there 's something cruel about all this. 
 perhaps this movie would have played well as a black comedy, but the movie is a romantic comedy. 
 we are supposed to be rooting for these creeps. 
 reiner and screenwriter leslie dixon tried to make it easier on us by making the victims unlikeable. 
 lilly 's husband is a new- age flake who rambles about"" emotional valet parking,"" so we can write him off as irrelevant 
. 
 dan 's wife is vain, manipulative, and jealous so 
 we can write her off as a bitch. 
 molly 's husband is a career- conscious, self- centered republican politician who thinks she 's too fat( and just for good measure, he also fucked dan 's wife), so we can write him off as a prick

 everyone else falls in",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its portrayal of adultery as hilarious and its message of ignoring responsibilities. The reviewer also mentions that the movie is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but the characters are unlikeable and cruel."
"it 's probably inevitable that the popular virtual reality genre("" the matrix,"""" existenz"") would collide with the even more popular serial- killer genre("" kiss the girls,"""" se7en""). 
 the result should have been more interesting than"" the cell. 
"" 
 as the movie opens, therapist catharine deane( jennifer lopez) treats a catatonic boy( colton james) by entering his mind through some sort of virtual reality technique that 's never fully explained. 
 after months of therapy sessions in a surreal desert, catharine has no success to report. 
 meanwhile, killer carl stargher( vincent d'onofrio) has claimed another victim. 
 his particular hobby is to kidnap young women, keep them in a glass cell overnight, and drown them. 
 he takes the corpse and soaks it in bleach, then suspends himself over the body and jerks off while watching a video tape of the drowning. 
 although carl 's been doing this for awhile, he 's recently become sloppy, and fbi agent peter novak( vince vaughn) is closing in fast. 
 not fast enough, though, to keep carl from sticking another woman( tara subkoff) in the cell or to catch him before he suffers a schizophrenic attack that leaves him in a coma. 
 from the videos in carl 's house, peter can see that the drowning cell is automated and will fill with water forty hours after the abduction. 
 to save the kidnapped girl, peter has to find the cell before the end of the day, and comatose carl 's not talking. 
 so off they go to catharine in the hope that she can go inside carl 's mind and find out where the cell is in time. 
 the focus of"" the cell"" in on the ornate interior of carl 's mind, but the universe director tarsem singh creates seems more an exercise in computer- generated spectacle than an exploration of the psychotic personality. 
 for the most part, it 's style without substance. 
 in his own mind, carl is a decadent emperor in flowing robes",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its lack of substance and its focus on style over exploration of the psychotic personality. The reviewer also mentions that the movie is more of an exercise in computer-generated spectacle than an interesting story.
"david lynch 's"" blue velvet"" begins and ends with colorful, bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town. 
 however, what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a"" strange world"" of drug dealers, sadists, and murderers. 
 the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy, disturbing film. 
 they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances. 
 odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film, its characters, its direction, and its story. 
 thankfully, the obscurity that"" blue velvet"" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable. since its elements are so originally weird, you never know what will happen next. 
 this is the main goal of a movie; to be spontaneous and surprising. 
"" blue velvet"" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting. 
 lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling. 
 the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy( kyle maclachlan). 
 from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer( isabella rossellinia) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping. 
 the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch 's story telling so amazing. 
 maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship, in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick, and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends. 
 through these multiple stories, maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan, we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots. 
 lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion. 
 instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times. 
",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the movie for its originality, spontaneity, and surprising elements. The reviewer also compliments the director's storytelling style and the interesting subplots in the movie."
"i have a great idea for a movie, one that ca n't miss. 
 see, i 've got coolio to do a song for the soundtrack, and about fifty athletes and celebrities to do cameo appearances. 
 it 's about professional basketball, so i 'll release it right around the nba finals to guarantee added publicity. 
 as for what the movie is actually about... 
 well, that will all sort itself out eventually. 
 i figure it will be a comedy, so i 'll throw a half- dozen writers at it and take the best of whatever they come up with. 
 maybe we 'll put a gender spin on it, see if we can get some women out to see it, too. 
 eddie is one of those phenomenally lazy films that infuriates me more than any other kind. 
 twister, as inane as the script might have been, at least required some creative technicians; mission: impossible, overwrought plot and all, at least involved genuine effort. 
 eddie just sits there, hawking up a formula story without any laughs, and makes every possible bad decision when a decision is required. 
 whoopi goldberg plays eddie franklin, a new york limo driver and die- hard knicks fan who is suffering through a dismal season for her beloved team. 
 coach john bailey( dennis farina) has lost control of his overpaid prima donnas, and the losses are beginning to mount. 
 the dwindling attendance inspires new team owner wild bill burgess( frank langella) to try a publicity stunt in which a lucky fan will get to be an honorary coach of the team. 
 the winner( surprise, surprise) is eddie, who becomes a fan favorite, and eventually the actual coach. 
 the knicks continue to lose, but eddie has some sassy tricks up her sleeve to inspire her troops. 
 incidentally, the knicks eventually start winning. 
 please raise your hand if that comes as a shock, and i will invite you to my all- night marathon of the bad news bears, major league, angels in the",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its formulaic story, lack of laughs, and bad decisions.

 here is a sample review: welcome to sarajevo in light of america 's recent intervention in kosovo, welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years. 
 set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events, this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war. 
 the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding. 
 as they make their way down the street, a sniper shoots the mother of the bride. 
 yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war. 
 in this scene, we meet joe flynn( woody harrelson), an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church. 
 joe is cocky, but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he does n't even know. 
 his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson( stephen dillane). 
 michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the world 's lack of interest. 
 henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mother 's death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread. 
 he decides to take action when a united nations' delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth. 
 henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines. 
 he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult. 
 during his visits, he befriends a pre- teen girl, emira( emira nuseric) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner.

 at the crossgates mall cinema 18 
( guilderland, ny), theater# 8, with matt perreault and my sister jena for free( matt paid using pre- paid passes). 
 if there 's ever been an exception to the perils of excessive cliches and non- stop action, the james bond films are it. 
 and if there 's ever been a james bond film that not only proves this, but does so by pushing it to the extreme,"" tomorrow never dies"" is it. 
 opening sequences almost always make or break action films. 
 when done properly, not only are they actually exciting, but they foreshadow things to come. 
 this film starts off on the right foot by establishing the kind of atmosphere that could only be found in an action movie, but with a sense of the self- aware, enclosed universe where james bond movies take place in. 
 first there 's a high- tech, slightly complicated scene involving a british warship crossing into unfriendly, chinese waters. 
 there 's definite tension as there seems to be an unknown, but certainly hostile, third party involved who is manipulating both sides. 
 when the scene ends in tragedy, it 's clear there 's some kind of powerful conspiracy going on, and who else to call on for such a case but james bond? 
 the film uses good judgment 
 in the way it introduces us to bond( brosnon). 
 as the enemy was portrayed as evil and mysterious, bond is clearly( and obviously) depicted as an out- and- out hero. 
 he single- handedly takes out a small army of terrorists, and then must escape in the nick of time by flying away in a fighter jet while the co- pilot tries to strangle him and a terrorist in another jet tries to shoot him down! 
 this might sound like the kind of cliches films like this are notorious for( over-) using, but it works here because the film knows how to get",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film's execution of cliches and action sequences, the tension and atmosphere created, and the portrayal of the characters, especially James Bond. The reviewer also mentions that the film starts off on the right foot and uses good judgment in introducing the characters."
"there 's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably should n't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did. 
"" lucky numbers"" is a perfect example of this because it 's such a blatant rip- off of"" fargo"" and 
 every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet 
 it somehow still works for me. 
 i know i 'm in the minority here but let me explain. 
 the film takes place in harrisburg, pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter. 
 john travolta plays the local big- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards. 
 russ is married to crystal( lisa kudrow), a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema. 
 she 's a selfish, nasty bitch full of lust and desire 
 but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl- 
 not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market. 
 crystal 's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick( ed o'neil), the tv station manager. 
 she does n't seem to genuinely like either of them, but it 's all she can do in this one- horse town. 
 much like"" fargo,"" this movie tells the story of a man who 's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick. 
 he enlists the help of his english friend gig( tim roth), the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery. 
 along the way a subplot involving a two- bit thug named, accurately,"" dale the thug""( michael rappaport) gets mixed up in the process. 
 there 's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down. 
 i 'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you 're not expecting. 
 this is a farce, which is basically a straightforward, adult- oriented comedy but does",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer admits to enjoying the film despite its similarities to other works. The reviewer appreciates the film's plot twists and turns, the representation of characters, and the unfolding of the story. The reviewer also mentions that the film works for them, indicating a positive sentiment."
" footloose"" has only one goal in mind: to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel- good antics. 
 and i hate to admit it; i fell for it. 
 the movie is about a teenager( bacon) who moves to a small town from the big city, and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend( lithgow). 
 he ends up falling for the preacher 's daughter( singer) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do. 
 as mentioned at the beginning of this review,"" footloose"" is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama. 
 there are virtually no surprises, and the writing is second- rate. 
 so 
 why did i enjoy it so much? for one thing, 
 the cast is great. 
 kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role. 
 we 're rooting for him right from the start, and, unlike most films of this genre, bacon does n't play him as the"" rebel without a clue"" sort. 
 yes, he does rebel, but he 's also polite when he needs to be. 
 and he never broods. 
 the rest of the cast is equally impressive. 
 john lithgow, seen here playing a normal guy for a change, is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian. 
 but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter. 
 by the end of the film, we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character. 
 another nice touch is the music. 
 we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with"" sexual innuendos"", but that 's not true at all. 
 the title track, performed by kenny loggins, is upbeat and fun. 
 during the final sequence, i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing

 of course, i soon realized that would be a little pathetic",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer admits to enjoying the film despite its predictability and hokiness.

"since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they 're portraying, it 's fitting to say that"" beloved"" come as a real shock as a film. 
 it 's confusing, bizarre, and as tough a film to watch as any film i 've seen all year, and that 's not necessarily because of the three- hour running time. 
"" beloved"" is challenging to watch, filled with tough and powerful poetry 
 that takes us completely off guard, and instead of a straight- forward, hollywood- ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed,"" beloved"" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened( or, rather, toni morrison, who wrote the novel upon which this is based). 
"" beloved"" tells the story of an ex- slave named sethe, played by oprah winfrey, who lives on a large farm in the north with her children. 
 when the film opens, her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist, which shakes things up, wounds the dog, and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family. 
 sethe is proud, though, and will not move. 
 her sons run away, leaving only her and her daughter, denver( kimberly elise) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation. 
 a couple years pass, and the ghost remains, and one day, a man named paul d( danny glover), another ex- slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together, arrives, asking for lodging. 
 he has been wandering around since he left the plantation, and when he enters the house, it turns red and becomes incredibly hot. 
 when he remarks about what he thinks is evil, sethe replies"" it ai n't evil.

"as i walked out of crouching tiger, hidden dragon 
 i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film 
. 
 with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a"" great"" piece of work and viceversa. 
 attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs. 
 i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology. 
 as the word implies, a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master. 
 as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality. 
 crouching tiger, hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category. 
 crouching tiger, hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore, with the requisite blend of legend, fantasy, magic and mythology. 
 it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half- gods- greater than life, purer than life, stronger than life, physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats, but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable. 
 all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix, including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement. 
 the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop, with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil, which must choose between the two. 
 it is the gifted pupil who, under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend. 
 the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters) are poignantly represented. 
 the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively. 
 the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours- de- force, not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art, as are the prodigious leaps and flights",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the film's quality, immersion, and representation of oriental folklore. The reviewer appreciates the fight scenes, the characters, and the classic elements of oriental mystique in the film. The reviewer also mentions that the film fits comfortably in the category of a masterpiece, indicating a high level of admiration."

 martha fiennes' debut feature is( quite literally) filmed poetry 
( it 's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin), a profound study of regret, of how we confuse shame with guilt. 
 when we first meet eugene onegin( ralph, acting for his sister; another brother, magnus, composed the score), a philandering aristocrat from st. 
 petersburg, he has just inherited his uncle 's estate. with plans to sell it, onegin pays a summer visit to the manor, which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside, and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods. 
 smitten with olga larina( headey), he befriends olga 's fianc?, vladimir lensky( stephens), while olga 's sister, tatyana( tyler), romanticizing his flippant attitude( he 's a nineteenth bad boy), falls for onegin. 
 in one sweaty, inky torrent of passion, tatyana writes him a love letter. 
 he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections, it is implied, because he can. 
 soon after, tragedy strikes, and onegin makes himself scarce. 
 when we catch up with him, six years later, he has just returned to st. 
 petersburg, where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend( donovan) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana. 
 this time, onegin finds her irresistable. 
 what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch.

The reviewer also mentions that the film is a profound study of regret, indicating a deep emotional impact, which suggests a positive sentiment."
"if there 's one thing 
 i just ca n't stand, it 's a film that oozes with sentimentality. 
 here 's a note to all film makers: films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves. 
 swelling, saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy, and that the situation is hopeless. alas, my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up. 
 what reminded me was that i was n't choked up, or even the slightest bit moved, for that matter. 
 my giant is a forced, contrived, and conspicuously un- cute 
( i detest the word"" cute"" but i 've chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a"" cute"" film here). 
 it takes a premise that might have been interesting( i liked the preview), and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches, all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience. 
 maybe it will work for some people. 
 it did n't work for me. 
 billy crystal plays sam cayman, an agent who, at the beginning of the film, is in romania. 
 he 's in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film.

 ned kelly, the so- called robin hood of the aussies.

 the film opens to a b/ w prologue of ned kelly bravely going to his execution. 
 then it goes to technicolor and ned is seen in what goes for flashback, coming home from jail after a 3-year sentence to see his mom and reacquaint himself with the large kelly family.

 ned 's romp through australia 's outback, seeking justice for all the wrongs his people have suffered. 
 he begins by stealing horses, after complaining about the unfair tax law on horses that stray, which favors the rich landowners.

"steven spielberg 's"" amistad,"" which is based on the true story of a group of africans who revolted on board a slave ship, then were captured and taken to america where a legal dispute ensued over who"" owned"" them, is concerned with several different aspects of this story. 
 first, the film addresses the issue of the inherent evils of slavery. 
 second, it deals with the historical involvement of several american politicians in the case, including president martin van buren and former president john quincy adams( anthony hopkins). 
 last, and most importantly, it examines the cultural confusion experienced by the africans who were forced into slavery and the damage done to their native culture in africa by the slave trade. 
"" amistad"" succeeds at least partly with all three of these elements. 
 i have to admit that i was a little skeptical as to how much i could really get out of another"" anti- slavery"" movie. 
 having seen several other movies and documentaries about slavery, i doubted that there was much i did n't already know about it. 
 fortunately, i turned out to be wrong. 
 for one thing, spielberg 's camera never once gets near a southern plantation and instead sticks to the slave ships and the slave traders' operations in africa, so"" amistad"" was dealing with a different part of the history of slavery from the very beginning. 
 and some of the images here are, in fact, much more harrowing than what we usually see in movies about slavery. 
 one scene in the middle, in which the crew of a slave ship dispose of some of their"" excess"" slaves by throwing them overboard to drown, has to be one of the most disturbing film images of the year. 
 spielberg digs farther into the evils of slavery than i was expecting he would, and in fact he probably goes about as far as a movie director can without getting an nc-17 rating. 
 the stark suffering of the africans is contrasted sharply with the shallow luxury of the politicians, such as president van buren and",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film's depiction of the evils of slavery, the historical involvement of American politicians, and the cultural confusion experienced by the Africans.

 i guess that i was expecting the former going in. 
 the film is somewhat interesting to a point, but i was personally never able to involve myself too much, as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant.

"based on the novel set in 1914 by joseph conrad, victory spins a tale of a pair of lovers, heyst( william dafoe) and alma( irene jacob), who seek refuge on heyst 's isolated island. 
 however, their idyllic world begins to crumble upon the arrival of mr jones( sam neil), martin ricardo( rufus sewell) and their servant, pedro( graziano marcelli), who have come to steal heyst 's rumoured plunder. 
 while the novel is largely complex in characterization, the film sadly transposes conrad 's characters into lacklustre leads, the most disappointing being heyst himself. 
 conrad 's heyst adheres religiously to his late father 's ways of detachment and isolation. 
 his ascetic lifestyle is thrown into question when he meets alma, a helpless orchestra girl who charms him with her voice. 
 the struggle to embrace the arrival of alma into his solitude, however, is lost in mark peploe 's( director and writer) diluted version of heyst. without properly establishing the crucial details of heyst 's character, all that is left of conrad 's main character is a very shallow treatment of his internal conflict between detachment and human involvement. 
 on the one hand, actualizing the subtext is a mammoth task( though not impossible), but on the other hand, dafoe 's flat acting can not be excused as an attempt at stoicism. 
 in the end, we are supposed to witness heyst renounce his philosophy and finally come to an understanding of what it is to love another. 
 the final transformation, while perceptible, lacks the cathartic revelation which is undeniable in conrad 's novel. 
 its absence in the film is unforgivable. 
 the film seems more concerned about moving the plot along when so much has yet to be said about the relationship between the two complete strangers. 
 alma is supposed to have overcome great emotional barriers in the relationship, namely heyst 's underlying philosophy of detachment, which heyst himself grapples with. 
 the struggle against heyst 's ignorance of true human involvement accounts for much of the greatness of alma 's love for him. 
",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the film for its lacklustre leads and shallow treatment of the main character's internal conflict. The reviewer also mentions that the film fails to properly establish the crucial details of the main character's character and lacks the cathartic revelation present in the original novel.
"it seems that i 've stopped enjoying movies that should be fun to watch. 
 take payback, for example, a movie that most people seem to like. however, 
 it 's horrible schlock, straight out of hollywood 's vast talent for sucking creativity out of movies.

 mel gibson, 
 that hollywood zombie 
, decided he did n't like the ending and had another director reshoot it. 
 what a crock. if you sign on to do a movie, then do it the way the script calls for. 
 why film a movie and then look at it later and say,- no, i changed my mind, i do n't like the ending. 
 you 're fired. 
 let 's get someone else to do it. 
- i suppose honor is dead in hollywood. 
 the end of the film is, of course, hollywoodized. which is to say that it 's happy and the guy you root for beats impossible odds to win his prize. 
 in this case, as is most victories in hollywood movies, gibson 's prize is a blond and money. 
 i miss originality in film, i really do. 
 i think audiences are so starved for it that they 'll flop down a lot of money in hopes that a movie will be original. 
 payback 's tagline- get ready to root for the bad guy- promised an original idea, but it was far from the truth. 
 while gibson 's character certainly broke the law, he was a character that had honor( odd that gibson himself seems to have very little of it), would n't kill in front of children and protects his blond woman.

"a friend invites you to a movie. 
 this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare, and be grounded in reality. 
 the plot is as follows: after a terrifying incident, a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city. 
 they need fresh air to get some perspective, maybe to start over. 
 romance begins to brew, however, as one of the locals, played by an international superstar in rugged clothing, sparks things up,( especially at a country- western slow dance).

 first- time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth.

 but george finally gets a chance to funnel his creativity into something productive when his uncle wins channel 62 in a poker game and makes him the general manager of the struggling uhf television station.

"after bloody clashes and independence won, lumumba refused to pander to the belgians, who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo.

 with unrest building, moise tshombe( pascal nzonzi) and the province of katanga, which contained 70 percent of the country 's resources, proclaimed secession. 
 lumumba replaced janssens, making mobutu a colonel, and went on a pacification tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu( maka kotto), but it was too late.' when you want to drown a dog, you say it has rabies,' prophesies lumumba of his own fate. 
 peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players, although they frequently succumb to cliche, particularly regarding lumumba 's private life. 
 peck 's script illuminates bantu sayings like' the hand that gives, rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador. 
 peck 's direction is less assured, with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare. 
 he 's served well, though, by his casting of ebouaney in the title role. 
 ebouaney is dynamic, radiating his character 's fierce passion for his people and his country.

 computer generated aliens. 
 ok, the movie is not just about computer generated aliens. 
 it 's about computer generated aliens and a secret organization known as mib. 
 if one was n't green and running around the other would not exist as it 's known. 
 the computer graphics in this movie are spectacular, they make you want to believe that aliens like the ones depicted exits. 
 since seeing this movie i have to agree concede that denis rodman is an alien, he simply has to be. 
 well, in all seriousness the aliens created here are not only of the monster variety but are also of the soft, squishy and cuddly kind. 
 just adds something of a lighter note to the movie where it could have become very dark. 
 along with aliens comes the humor and in a pretty decent way. 
 j, well soon to be j, a smart ass cop( played by will smith) runs down what he thinks is a would- be villain and gets some attention from the mib and k in particular. 
 k aims to recruit our poor j, but that is not the whole point of this movie. 
 the main duty of the mib is to police the extra terrestrials on earth who have chosen it as a home or a refuge. 
 that 's also the main point of this movie: protect the earth from the scum of the galaxy. 
 some of the scum from space is awfully bad and just down right nasty. 
 color commentary abounds when forced to deal with alien scum and none other than will smith and tommy lee jones are there to deliver the punch.

 as the parrot, mohr is delightful when director john roberts allows him to cut up. 
 benny, on the other hand, is a character you 've seen a thousand times before, and mohr brings nothing new to that role.

 kate( helena bonham carter) and merton( linus roache) are in love. 
 merton, a newspaper writer, would like to marry kate. 
 but kate 's"" job"", if you will, is to be a member of the british upper class.

 kate realizes that if merton were introduced to millie, he might forget about her.

"well if you are up for stellar effects then this is the movie for you. 
 because that s all that there really is.. 
.. 
 i found that after watching this movie it had many many gaps and flaws in simple logic in the plot 
. 
 for one thing, a white leading actor who has a black daughter does leave some curiosity.... 
 i am not saying that this is n't possible.. 
 but it does leave one to wonder... 
 i know i did. 
 another thing is that this movie has sections which are painfully stretched out.... and certain scenes are repeated essentially but with slight variations. 
 there was one scene that should have been short... 
 but it was horribly stretched and somewhere in the middle of it i found myself thinking.. 
 ok enough already get on with it. 
 there are also times where you have to wonder why things happen the way they do... 
 things just magically happen and there is no prelude or anything of the sort 
.. 
. 
 another thing that i noticed towards the end was that some characters just vanished without a trace but they were fairly major through most of the beginning. 
 this movie is also very predictable... 
 you can almost tell the final story somewhere in the middle and you definitely know what will happen at a given moment.. 
 granted this is hard to omit but here its just blatant it sits there and stares at you. 
 also some of the things that happen are a little too predictable and several cliques are repeated... 
 it gets boring at times to tell you the truth... 
 even though there is still action going on. 
 another little point i might add is that the main character is supposed to be a quiet chaos mathematician not some shoot them up type of hero. 
 some of the characters are not proper for their roles. 
 the acting is fine but 
 the characters just do n't seem to add up",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer points out several flaws in the movie, including gaps in the plot, scenes that are unnecessarily stretched out, characters disappearing without explanation, and predictability.

" america 's sweethearts"" has an intriguing premise and a great cast, but it is n't nearly as edgy or funny as it should be.

"the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do. 
 lives are often at stake, and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable, prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment 's notice. 
 the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor, psychologist, and sham artist, in addition to being a police officer; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence, or failing that, must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower. 
 most of all, the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible, and quickly gain control of the situation, dominate the conversation, and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants.

 it was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident. 
 its violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before. 
 in style, content, and how it was conceived and produced,"" sweet sweetback"" was a cinematic revolution, whether or not one agrees with its subject matter. 
 van peebles, a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france, built"" sweet sweetback"" from the ground up almost entirely by himself. 
 because no studio would dare fund such a film, he was forced to raise all the money himself. 
 the movie ended up costing about$ 500, 000, part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby. 
 van peebles cut costs by hiring non- union labor and taking on most of the film 's responsibilities himself. 
 he wrote the script, scored the music, edited and directed the film, as well as starred in the central role. 
 he was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck.

 in spiceworld, the highly popular singing group the spice girls accomplish their major goal: mocking themselves with a purposely cheezy film and having a lot of fun doing it.

 honestly, i 'd rather see this film before many others i gave higher grades,

 two dalmatians, pongo and perdy, fall in love at first sight.

 the heavenly match- ups turn chaotic when pongo and perdy 's new- born pups are stolen; their dog- napping engineered by the evil cruella devil, who wants them for their pelts. 
 everyone in the animal kingdom then joins in a frantic effort to save the puppies. 
 in the original movie, the animated pooches had a broad range of facial expressions and distinct personalities.

 but hey he got 15 million, what 's it matter to him? 
 once again arnold has signed to do another expensive blockbuster, that ca n't compare with the likes of the terminator series, true lies and even eraser. 
 in this so called dark thriller, the devil( gabriel byrne) has come upon earth, to impregnate a woman( robin tunney) which happens every 1000 years, and basically destroy the world, but apparently god has chosen one man, and that one man is jericho cane( arnold himself).

"for a film touted as exploring relationships and black sexuality, trois is surprisingly tame. 
 despite it 's lurid subject matter and it 's passing nod to fatal attraction, 
 it moves along with flat, uninspired dialogue as it sets up a surprising climax that tries mightily to overthrow the considerable dead weight of the rest of the film. 
 freshly moved to atlanta, jermaine( dourdan) and his wife, jasmine( moore), have the trappings of a perfect life. 
 they have a beautiful house in suburbia.

"this christmas, little ralphie parker( peter billingsley) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree. 
 although cautioned by many that he will? 
 shoot his eye out', ralphie remains optimistic, conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers. 
 it could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun, and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one. 
` a christmas story' is a favorite among many during the holiday season, and boy, 
 it is certainly easy to see why. 
 ralphie 's endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood, when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable. 
 evoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things` a christmas story' does so well. 
 here are a few features that make this film such a charming little package 
 for everybody during the holiday season: 1) period detail. 
 this film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard, who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940 's with loving detail. 
 shepard narrates from a first person point- of- view, divulging his various adventures one snowy december, in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head. 
 shepard 's first- hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious, but also witty and warm, with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing. 
 on top of that, young billingsley 's stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration. 
 director bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality.

 what disaster is that? 
"" 
 you ask, as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat. 
 glad you asked. 
 through a whole sequence of entirely probable events( about as probable as hitting the lottery) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city. 
 the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends, which causes not only massive loss of life, but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel. 
 good old sly, who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses, offers his services to the rescuers, who gladly accept it. 
 sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft( think judge dredd) which he can only go in, and not out off, and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside. 
 so begins the fun, but the fun has to be quick, because this tunnel has started to spring a leak. 
 the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie.

 as that song, really. 
 it follows the lives of several individuals over the course of one weekend. 
 first we hear about a grocery bagger( sara polley) who runs into a monetary situation problem and ends up selling bogus drugs at a rave( with bad results, as a drug dealer feels he 's been swindled by her) 
; then comes the story of an english grocery store worker( same store) who heads to vegas for the weekend with friends, where sex, gunplay, and stolen car trouble come into play; then we see the story of two gay movie actors( played by scott wolf and jay mohr) who deal with a cop 's strange insurance presentation and hitting a girl( sara) with their car; and, finally, we come to another grocery worker( katie holmes) who has a strange fascination with said drug dealer( the one mentioned earlier).

, your best bet is to just, well, go. 
 the movie features some very good acting from all angles, and limon adds the same humorous energy he had with swingers to this particular product.

 he had never seen any episodes of the show, and i have watched a scant few, due to its unsocial airtime on comedy central and the uneven nature of many of the episodes. 
 for those of you not familiar with the premise, dr clayton forrester( beaulieu) wishes to take over the world by finding the worst film ever made and unleashing it upon an unsuspecting public. 
 to achieve this, he( in the words of the tv series' theme, which is missing in the movie)"" bumped[ mike nelson( nelson)] on the noggin and then shot him into space"", and is monitoring nelson 's reactions to the movies he is forced to endure. rather than succumb to the sheer awfulness of many of the movies, nelson spends his time making wisecracks with the help of his two robot companions, tom servo and crow t. robot. 
 the format of the show consists of nelson, servo and crow making their comments while silhouetted against the movie being watched, and breaks every 20 minutes or so for segments set on the satellite of love, the ship on which our heroes are marooned. 
 only two things are different in the movie: the absence of forrester 's sidekick, tv 's frank, and the slower pace of the jokes.

 strike one was the fact that someone had scrawled the word garbage on the videotape 's sticker in black marker

 tracks of a killer itself completed the strikeout. 
 about the only positive thing this film had going for it was the fact that it sports some nice scenery. 
 to be fair, the first half- hour or so promises at least a watchable thriller.

"there is a scene early in jakob the liar that hints at how much better it could have been. 
 the scene is set in a jewish ghetto in poland circa 1944, where a one- time cafe proprietor named jakob heym is walking resolutely through the streets, fists stuffed into coat pockets. 
 to one side of him, residents scavenge for food in the street; to the other side, german troops beat a group of jews. 
 jakob, however, never stops moving. 
 it 's an efficient, effective set- up for the character, who is clearly nobody 's idea of a hero at the outset. 
 he is a man who has responded to the horror of his surroundings by withdrawing from them, excising his moral peripheral vision. 
 the set- up is critical because fate will turn jakob into a reluctant savior. 
 after a visit to a german commandant 's office and a moment alone with a turned- on radio, jakob learns that russian troops are quite near. 
 when he brings this first news of the war in years to his fellow jews, they become convinced that he must have a radio, which is a punishable offense in the ghetto. 
 the good news brings hope to the ghetto; the everyday specter of suicide vanishes. 
 a private man of limited creativity finds himself burdened with creating stories of russian military progress just to keep his neighbors alive. 
 this promising story of an ordinary person doing the extraordinary is burdened from the outset by casting: the"" ordinary person"" in question, jakob heym, is played by robin williams. 
 i am of the depressing opinion that williams is growing less assured as an actor in his"" serious"" roles with every passing year. compare his dramatic scenes in the world according to garp and moscow on the hudson with what dreams may come or patch adams, and see how much more mannered he has become( or, at the very least, how much less sensible at choosing material).

 quick and easy review: i really enjoyed matinee. 
 the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely. 
 unlike many comedies this film tries, and succeeds, in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh. 
 the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story. 
 the performances of all the principals are right on the mark, particularly john goodman as the schlock master.

 i enjoyed this film was, that while being a comedy, the film also had an intelligent story to tell. 
 too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh. 
 you watch the movie, laugh a lot, leave the theatre and take nothing with you.

"what is freedom? 
 how does one determine who is free? 
 in 1839, those questions were more difficult to answer then they are now. 
 yet, the mistakes of our forefathers must be examined in order to rectify current situations. 
 that is, in essence, what steven spielberg 's gripping drama"" amistad"" is about. 
 through its various dramas, spielberg presents a case about a group of africans, who, after being seized from their home, were forced onto a ship and sent to the united states aboard"" la amistad"". 
 on their way there, the slaves, led by cinque( djimon hounsou), rebelled, killing off part of the crew. 
 however, the ship was still directed towards the united states, where the africans were brought to trial under murder. 
 in the court, various factions claim ownership of the slaves, and therefore try to seize them away. 
 the united states government, led by president martin van buren( nigel hawthorne), and secretary of state secretary forsyth( david paymer), try to ship the africans to spain, where an 11 year old isabella ii( anna paquin) wants them back. 
 the two spaniards who own"" la amistad"" want the slaves for themselves. 
 the american ship that found the slaves also wants them. 
 in the midst of this are two abolitionists( stellan skaarsgard and morgan freeman), who want the slaves to be free. 
 they enlist the help of lawyer matthew mcconaughey, who tries to free them. 
 through various legal proceedings, the case appears before the supreme court, where it is argued by ex- president john quincy adams( anthony hopkins). 
 the film itself is a visual wonder. 
 spielberg favorite janusz kaminski sets the film in a dark, somber mood when appropriate, and a visual setting when appropriate as well.

"ever since wargames, the first real computer hacking movie, hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking. 
 these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous. 
 if it 's not this, the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect. 
 hackers is guilty of all of these crimes. 
 to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet, most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you ca n't take it anymore. 
 those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web, the internet movie database, are probably aware of the section for movies entitled"" goofs"". 
 this is the section for mistakes in the movies. 
 well, imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed: 
"" generally ill- informed and ridiculous to the extreme 
 regarding the capabilities of computers and technology"". 
 and truthfully, this is one- hundred percent correct. 
 the plot, obviously, centers around computer hacking. 
 more specifically, it follows the exploits of dade murphy, a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller. 
 miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting, because if it were not for that, who knows where his career would be now after hackers. 
 the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems. 
 he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old. 
 the film then picks up at that point, an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer. 
 dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn( angelina jolie), cereal killer( matthew lillard), lord nikon( laurence mason), and the phantom phreak( renoly santiago), who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible: hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi.

"movies based on video games, such as street fighter or mario bros., have never generated much interest at the box office. 
 but when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995, it did surprisingly well. 
 with a simple story, a pulsating soundtrack, and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes, the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy. 
 it got my vote for' the movie where i expected the least and got the most'. 
 and, if you have n't had the opportunity, i would definitely recommend that you see it on video. 
 in the world of mortal kombat, based on the popular arcade game, dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth 's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity. 
 the mortal kombat refers to a competition, fought by human mortals against outworld 's minions, which if won, will guarantee earth 's safety for another generation. 
 mk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition. 
 despite their victory, however, a gateway has somehow opened, and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth. 
 outworld 's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters, including shao kahn, mintoro( a centaur), sheeva( a four- armed ogre), and sindel. 
 earth 's mortal warriors, under the leadership of the benevolent god, lord rayden, includes liu kang, princess kitana, sonya blade and jax, who must fight against outworld 's forces. 
 it 's an easy enough premise, but unfortunately( very unfortunately), the writers try to do too much with the movie 
. 
 it is only a video game, after all, but the on- screen version tries to go beyond it 's comic book boundaries by adding depth, a conceptualization of self- worth, and worst of all, a love story.

** 1/2: okay seats, sound, and picture] modern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before, from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes. 
 the biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it. 
"" 
 your friends and neighbors"" takes a different approach as it 's a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends. 
 one of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/ director neil labute 's basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story. 
 firstly, and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex, detailed story of lust, betrayal, arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and just plain stupidity between six different characters( three men, three women), without hardly any supporting characters,( a few have a line or two), mostly extras. 
 everything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full- circle back to themselves, whether it be positive or negative. 
 but to just state 
 this is arbitrary, and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult. 
 labute 's ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat, but what 's specifically impressive is the fact the characters' names are never revealed until the end credits roll.

 the story of us, a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family, is a well written, heartbreaking and insightful film

 the story of us tells the story of ben( bruce willis) and katie( michelle pfeiffer) jordan, and asks the question,"" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage? 
"" 
 the film is about two individuals who have come together, spent a good chunk of their lives together, and shows when our main characters are"" him"" and"" her""( during the bad times), and when they are"" us""( during the good times). 
 the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day. 
 ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they do n't want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer, or at least say they do n't, love each other anymore. 
 ben, a cartoonist, and katie, a crossword puzzle writer, have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage, as they have grown to follow different views on life, family, and marriage. 
 katie is the more organized, sophisticated type, who wants to plan everything out, while ben is a spontaneous, adventurous individual who does n't mind doing things differently than they were planned. 
 the story of us plays out nicely, as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist, told to the viewer through flashbacks.

"it was with great trepidation that i approached+ mary+, the farrelly brothers+ latest film. 
 i knew the film would be funny -- the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see. 
 but i also knew the film would be an equal- opportunity offender, attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon. 
 i figured the film would be raunchy, maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell. 
 i may laugh, but would i feel better in the morning? 
 i needn+t have worried. 
+ mary+ is the sweetest, warmest, all- out laugh- and- grossfest 
 this side of_ animal house_. 
 surprisingly, the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side, and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers. 
 they make laughter, the toughest job for a filmmaker to do, look easy. 
 the plot is typical. 
 thirteen years ago, geeky ted( ben stiller) lucked out in having dazzling mary( cameron diaz) go with him to the senior prom. 
 as luck would have it, on that very day, he was hospitalized. 
 why, i shall not tell, but i assure you, it isn+t pretty. 
 he hires a private investigator to find her: pat healy( matt dillon). 
 he becomes one of the great comic villains. upon finding her, he too is lovestruck, and so pursues her, lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped. 
 it is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double- crossed, and goes to get her for himself. 
 would the geek get the girl? 
 puh- lease. 
 the ending is pure hollywood; no surprises there.

 maybe it 's that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun

 it 's too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging, and if it were n't for woody allen, it would have been just a really clever good- not- great flick.

"susan granger 's review of"" hearts in atlantis""( castle rock/ warner bros.) 
 timing is everything, and the timing just seems right for this poignant psychological drama that combines the coming- of- age nostalgia of"" stand by me"" with the mystical power of"" the green mile. 
"" 
 based on stephen king stories adapted by screenwriter william goldman and directed by scott hicks, it 's set in 1960 in harwich, connecticut, where fatherless 11 year- old bobby garfield( anton yelchin) lives in a boarding house with his resentful, self- centered mother( hope davis). 
 he 's devoted to his neighborhood friends( mika boorem, will rothhaar) but his pivotal relationship is with a strange, new tenant, ted brautigan( anthony hopkins) who opens the world of literature to him after his selfish mother refuses to buy him a birthday gift and hands him, instead, a library card. 
 knowing he 's longing for a schwinn bike, ted offers to pay him$ 1 a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for signs of the malevolent, ominous low men who are chasing him to exploit his special powers. 
 the story structure consists of one long flashback, framed by the present, featuring the adult bobby( david morse), minimizing the supernatural elements while emphasizing the human drama hopkins' mysterious character is genteel, sensitive and benignly seductive. 
 the only explanation is that he 's a psychic who is wanted by the fbi to aid in their hunt for communists and even that seems appropriate, given the inexplicable state of the world right now. 
 the production values and performances are solid, particularly hopkins- arguably the finest, most versatile actor of our era- and the children with whom he forges a firm bond.

"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors, mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball. 
 fiercely unoriginal, director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him. 
 there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind. 
 the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars. 
 the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13. 
 interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001: a space odyssey. instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie, de palma stops right there, refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart. 
 mission to mars takes it 's first wobbly steps at a pre- launch barbeque in which the perfunctory character introductions are done. 
 during these surface scans of the characters, we learn that jim mcconnell( sinise) has lost his wife. 
 it 's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety. 
 the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability. 
 there is no contentiousness, no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time. 
 maybe depalma was going for the comraderie of the right stuff, but in that movie, the astronauts had embers of personality to warm us through the technical aspects.

 this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism. 
 they dare you to look away, without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children( they 're mouthpieces for writer- director catherine breillat 's one- note clinical politics). rather than show an even- handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change, breillat( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance) 
 wants to indulge in her hour of hate. 
 life is pain, highness. 
 get used to it. 
 she 'd find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz, other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest.

 this picture was so bad

"" hearts"" is a tribute to the magic of childhood, to those summers when the days seem neverending, and nothing means more than your closest friends. 
 unlike"" stand by me"", there is a supernatural element to"" hearts"", but although it is key to the plot, it is not prominent.

 yelchin is very good 
 as bobby, finding a good mix of innocence and resignation. 
 more splendid still is boorem, whom i praised highly for her work in"" along came a spider"" and who is simply radiant here as carol. 
 and then there is hopkins, who despite playing such a quiet, introspective character as ted, nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen. 
 less successful is davis, whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish. 
 i also found it odd that bobby and carol 's other friend, sully( whose death as an adult sets up the movie 's flashback framing device), is paid virtually no attention.

 but lo and behold, here comes"" switchback,"" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as"" kiss the girls"" and"" i know what you did last summer. 
"" 
 but"" switchback"" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry, as the material it covers is old and tired, and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting. 
"" switchback"" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she 's watching. 
 we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse( dennis quaid), and that the kidnapper/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while. 
 he is promptly removed from the case, but this conflict of interest does n't keep him from offering pursuit. 
 lacrosse 's most recent trek takes him to a blood- soaked hotel room in amarillo, texas, where the local sheriff( r. lee ermey) is torn between his re- election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man.

" mercury rising"" has numerous flaws, but there is one that really stands out: its central plot device is unnecessary. 
 that 's right. 
 the major aspect of the film, that which is supposed to make it different from other routine government conspiracy/ action flicks could be dropped from the beginning, and the movie would turn out exactly the same, if not better. 
 this central device is the fact that a nine- year- old boy is autistic. 
 his name is simon, and an evil government bureaucrat named nicholas kudrow( alec baldwin) wants him dead because he unknowingly cracked a supersecret government code slipped into the back of a puzzle magazine by its programmers just to see if someone could beat it. 
 simon is intended to be the heart and soul of the film, and we are supposed to feel for him because he is a poor handicapped child thrown into a violent, unfair world against his will, with only a renegade fbi agent played by bruce willis to protect him. 
 the fact that he is autistic does nothing for the emotional intensity or the plot necessities of"" mercury rising. 
"" 
 i suppose the original novel upon which the movie was based did much more with this aspect of simon 's character and his relationship with willis, but here it is lost. 
 miko hughes, the young actor who plays simon, goes through the prescribed motions of being autistic: he walks slowly, drawls his words, kicks and screams when he 's touched, and has a hard time looking at other people.

"five years after his directorial debut based on stephen king 's writings called the shawshank redemption( 9/10), writer/ director frank darabont returns to the big screen with another prison film based on the famous scribblings of stephen king. 
 unlike the latter film, this one is a big, long, laborious bore. 
 plot: 
 a seven- foot death row inmate is discovered to have secret healing powers. 
 critique: this film is slow, drawn- out, boring, uninteresting, unexciting, predictable and topped with a couple of one- dimensional"" evil"" characters. 
 its only positive attribute lies in its actors who all do credible jobs and its message of hope and belief in miracles. 
 the real miracle of my night was the fact that i did not fall asleep during this straightforward, unimpressive film about a guy with special powers who we never truly understand or care about. 
 of course, much like all other death row cell blocks, this one is filled with decent inmates who all happen to be"" misunderstood"", except for one cookie- cutter crazy guy who is evil personified. 
 and let 's not forget all the guards on death row, who also happen to be angels from the heaven above, except for one cookie- cutter crazy guard who is also evil personified( and is there any reason why there are about six guards when there appears to be no more than three inmates???). 
 am i supposed to identify with anyone in this film? or even more importantly, am i supposed to give a rat 's ass about anyone in this film? 
 well, if i was, i sure missed that boat, because the only thing that i ended up caring about during this entire picture was the obscene amount of fat that tom hanks has been able to burrow under his loose chin. furthermore, 
 there is absolutely no reason in the world why director frank darabont needed to take three hours and ten minutes out of anyone 's life to present this story.

" showgirls"" is the first big- budget, big- studio film to receive an nc-17 rating. 
 and its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans 
 chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence. 
 but if"" showgirls"" is any indication of hollywood 's future, the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values -- bad moviemaking. 
"" showgirls"" is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene, and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter. 
 director paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas, who collaborated on another shock- value project, 1992 's"" basic instinct,"" follow the plight of a young woman( teen tv star elizabeth berkley) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer. 
 it 's a hackneyed premise to begin with, so not surprisingly, all of the stock characters are trucked out. 
 there 's the demanding producer. 
 the loyal friend. 
 the bitchy competitor. 
 lest i forget the scummy club owner. 
 of course, any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film 's main attraction -- an endless parade of full- frontal nudity. 
 unfortunately,"" showgirls"" does n't satisfy in this department. 
 verhoeven 's slam- bang, in- your- face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic. 
 to make matters worse, you 'll be forced to sit through the movie 's clothed scenes, which do n't cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history. 
 verhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground, but if it 's adult entertainment you want, stay home and watch the playboy channel. 
 you 'll be the wiser for it.

 i have never liked john carpenter and his style. 
 after seeing this film, my opinions have not changed. 
 john carpenter remains john carpenter. 
 however, because of the film 's self- irony, black humour and fascinating cinematography, i would say that it is his greatest achievement in a long, long time. 
 neither the synopses or carpenter 's direction are original. 
 but there are some things that are interesting. 
 the director 's negative view on the catholic church, for instance. 
 at the end of the film it becomes clear that cardinal alba( maximilian schell) has simply used crow and his team to find valek, so that he would gain eternal life. 
 otherwise the catholic priests are shown cool- drinking, smoking and breaking the rool of celibacy. 
 carpenter has created an interesting atmosphere. 
 set in new mexican dessert, he switches between bright golden sunrises and bloody sundowns, symbolically illustrating the good and the evil through light and darkness. 
 more than anything in this film, this simple illustration shows the battle between good and evil. 
 the cinematography by gary b. kibbe is probably the film 's greatest achievement.

"if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue, we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia. 
 although some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories( mostly in ironic way, like grosse pointe blank and romy& michelle 's high school reunion), some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones.

"there is a rule when it comes to movies. 
 a sequel is never as good as the original. 
 there are very few exceptions to this rule, and texas chainsaw massacre: the next generation is not one of them. 
 now if you also take into consideration that the original chainsaw massacre was a really bad movie, and that this is n't even the first sequel to it, 
 you have a recipe for a very painful viewing experience.

 matthew mcconaughey( a time to kill) and renee zellweger( jerry maguire). 
 they made this movie before they were stars. 
 judging by their performances they also made it before they took any acting lessons. 
 it 's a wonder they ever worked in hollywood again after appearing in this turkey. 
 apparently the producers of this film realized just how bad it was, because it sat unreleased for years until someone decided that they might be able to capitalize off the success of mcconaughey and zellweger. 
 apparently the two young stars were none too happy about this thing ever seeing the light of day. 
 and i do n't blame them, they would have been better off if this had been some sort of porno flick starring the two of them. 
 unfortunately for them 
 it is a horror film in which zellweger plays your typically stupid horror film character. while mcconaughey plays a guy who wears a mechanical brace on his leg that he controls with a television remote control.

"devotees of robert a. heinlein, be forewarned: paul verhoeven 's starship troopers is less an adaptation of heinlein 's novel than it is a literary satire. 
 the author 's jingo- all- the- way militarism and his tendency to create plastic characters with plastic conflicts had me expecting a soulless, faceless parade of carnage from the film version. 
 and i suppose that 's exactly what verhoeven delivers, with sometimes hilarious results. 
 heinlein 's basic motifs are so faithfully rendered that their flaws become a source of amusement, while their strengths become the stuff of high- energy entertainment. 
 outlining the plot of starship troopers is a fairly silly endeavor, since it 's basically a big bug hunt... 
 aliens in broad daylight. 
 sometime in the future, humanity is threatened by giant, malevolent insects which have evolved into twenty- foot- tall action figures( arachnids with super- impaling spikes, beetles that spew forth lava, dragonflies with guillotine legs). 
 among those who sign on to save the earth are a group of high school classmates from buenos aires: conflicted rich kid johnny rico( casper van dien); his math whiz girlfriend carmen( denise richards); dizzy( dina meyer), who secretly carries a torch for johnny; and carl( neil patrick"" doogie howser"" harris), who not- so- secretly carries a torch for dizzy, and also has a talent for speaking telepathically to ferrets.

 the voiceover is written by acclaimed author jamaica kincaid.

"susan granger 's review of"" the watcher""( universal) just what we need: another lurid, trashy serial killer saga. 
 this time, keanu reeves plays an elusive homicidal maniac who engages in a gruesome ticking- clock cat- and- mouse game with james spader, a burnt- out fbi agent who has suffered a traumatic nervous breakdown after too many years on the job with the lapd. 
 to taunt spader, who has relocated to chicago, reeves packs up his trusty piano wire and moves too. 
 before long, he starts mailing photographs of the lonely, unsuspecting young women who are his intended windy city victims, challenging spader, along with the chicago police department, to stop him within 24 hours before he strikes again. 
 in the midst of this murderous frenzy, there 's spader 's psychologist, played by marisa tomei, who is even less convincing as a medical professional than jennifer lopez in"" the cell.

 writers david elliot, clay ayers and darcy meyers, along with first- time director joe charbanic( helmer of music videos for reeves' band dogstar), dwell on the warped thrill of the methodology and the chase, revealing, early on, exactly whodunit since the killer says he and the cop"" need each other to give meaning to our lives.

 russell plays cash, a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts. 
 stallone plays tango, a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it; he does n't need the money. 
 in an effort to change his image, stallone goes for a yuppie, gq look in the film, wearing spectacles and three piece suits. 
 the two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names. 
 tango& cash is unbearably noisy. for starters, there 's harold faltermeyer 's annoying synthesized score, which gets old after four notes. to make matters worse

 simon 's poetry turns him into a local sensation, as it causes mute women to sing, high- school girls to swoon, and councilmen to rile against its"" pornographic"" content.

"the film starts out with a creepy opening sequence to which has the now classic and creepy score by writer/ director/ producer john carpenter who in my mind is a brilliant director, he really is. 
 he wrote this film, he directed this film, he produced this film and he made the excessively creepy score to this film. 
 i think he is and always will be famous for this classic which after 21 years has not lost it 's popularity 
 or it 's ability to scare the wits out of people. 
 i think i have seen' halloween' over 100 times and each time i find something new and brilliant, and each time i am scared even though i know what is going to happen 
. 
 i own three different versions of the film: a vhs regular version that came with a limited edition 20th anniversary t- shirt, a boxed edition vhs in a hardcover case digitally re- mastered with the original theatrical widescreen presentation, in a nifty plastic picture decorated box with a numbered snow- globe. 
 in other words 
 i am completely and utterly obsessed with the film. 
 it has changed horror movies forever and spawned six sequels with only 2, 4, and 7 being truly good. 
 it also spawned several cheap imitations of the film that were offensive in some ways to a true halloween fan. 
 since i heard about halloween being released on dvd in a limited edition of 30, 000 copies, i knew i had to buy one no matter what! 
 i did and man 
 to me 
 it 's the best dvd ever manufactured with the brilliance of the film

"coinciding with the emerging popularity of movies that deal with anything related to serial killers, relentless, 1989 low budget thriller about lapd detective sam dietz, played by character actor leo rossi, spawned three more sequels. relentless 3, third in the row, features sam dietz again, but this time detective, who had to catch vicious serial killer in his very first case, does n't want to deal with similar line of work. 
 divorced, demoralised and transferred, he reluctantly returns to his old post when los angeles becomes a hunting ground for another serial killer, and evidence indicate connection with one of dietz 's old cases. 
 to make things even more interesting, it seems that the killer deliberately stages murders in order to bring dietz to the investigation. 
 fans of the british tv films and mini- series like prime suspect or cracker would probably see a lot of similarities relentless series of movies. 
 they both feature vicious psychopathic killers, yet also give a lot of, usually depressive, details about chief investigator 's private lives. 
 this one is n't an exception, but similarities with british television are only in content. 
 the execution and style is different, which makes this film mediocre piece of entertainment at best 
. useless, gratuitous erotica also does n't help 
 either, obviously making this film longer than it should be. 
 the actors are good, though- leo rossi is fine as usual, and william forsythe plays one of more compelling villains in his career. 
 signy coleman as dietz 's love interest, is, on the other hand, quite miscast. 
 but she wo n't have to worry about it in the future career, since relentless 3 was n't supposed to be anybody 's finest moment anyway.

 pepper 's tells the story of the fictitious band made popular from the song( and album) of the same name, released in 1967. 
 of course, the movie was made eleven years later, the gibbs three have become the lonely hearts, peter frampton is the one and only billy shears, and aside from being about a rock band, the story does n't correlate to the song at all.

 but at least these characters are actually* people* in a beatles' song, whereas other characters such as strawberry fields( sandy farina) gets her name from a song about a* place* called strawberry fields.

 his first two films were classic films, the second one being one of the greatest films of all time.

 he made way too many tv appearances. 
 he mispronounced jackie chan 's name on the mtv movie awards.

"vampire lore and legend has always been a popular fantasy element, substantiated by not only the sheer number of movies about the subject, but also the proliferation of cults and sects of adherents. 
 and, unlike any of the more outlandish myths, the vampire holds some real- world probability( one study claims 1, 000 bloodsuckers exist worldwide, and places 50 in los angeles). 
 but lest the nasties be mistaken for simple comic book bad guys, john carpenter would like to remind us that they are- and always have been- a truly frightening element of the thriller genre. and remind us he does in his latest film, vampires. 
 there was some question, as halloween weekend approached, of how well vampires would do in comparison to new line cinema 's immensely successful blade, released in august. 
 the two films take noticeably different stands on the vampire issue, and do n't even agree on some basic points of the slaying method. 
( for instance, blade 's main weapons are silver and garlic, whereas main character jack crow 's technique is a wooden stake to the heart.) 
 blade also gives more of a face to the vampire civilization, while carpenter would like us to remain in the dark about how the pasties operate. 
 both have their advantages, and here, carpenter 's style lends itself to a darker breed of suspense rather than the action movie that blade director stephen norrington delievered. 
 when it 's all said and done, though, the vampires still kill and die with a bloody flourish; the level for gore is indeed set to maximum. 
 this time, our hero is vatican- sponsored slayer jack crow( james woods). 
 he 's a cynical, battle- worn veteran, and the best of his bunch. 
 he and his team are responsible for cleaning out the american southwest, and after exterminating a nest one night, they run up against a super- vampire( termed a"" master"") named valek( thomas ian griffith).

"synopsis: wealthy cuban landowner luis( banderas) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride. 
 not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia( jolie), she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit. 
 soon, julia has absconded with both luis' fortune and his heart, and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld, luis begins to realise that, for him, there is no turning back. 
 review: 
 given the absurdism of its would- be plot, it 's unlikely that"" original sin"" could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking, regardless of writer, director or stars. 
 this is, at its heart, b- movie junk: a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions. 
 that said,"" original sin"" could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it. 
 instead, cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production, and directs it as such. 
 the result is a vapid, uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses, as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill. 
 consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie: brightly- lit and mostly filmed from above, 
 it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show. 
 cristofer does n't even manage to capture the allure of cuba; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy, sensuous island paradise, it appears bland and lifeless. at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script, but are n't being given the chance. 
 the same can not be said of jane, whose billy is nebbish and transparent. 
 also unwise is the jolie framing sequence, which practically gives away the film 's denouement.

"cashing in on the success of white men ca n't jump and the failure of most of their solo vehicles( including the cowboy way and drop zone), wesley snipes and woody harrelson have reteamed, hoping that they can strike up the same success. 
 sadly, if this dismal, cliche ridden and mind- numbingly boring action pic is anything to go by, they have n't got a chance in hell of even coming close. 
 this time out, the duo play foster brothers who are transit cops. 
 following several run- ins with their tyrannical boss( robert blake), who is obsessed with the"" money train"" --a train which carries all the subway 's takings -- and will let nothing stop it 
( now* there 's* an original plot device), harrelson 's character decides to try and take off with the cash. 
 along the way, both of them fall in love with the same woman -- another transit cop who also hates her boss. 
 this leads to the typical sibling rivalry crap that you usually find in a film of this standard(' you were always the better brother' etc. 
 etc. etc.), and does n't help to add anything to the film. 
 given a better script, better performers in supporting roles and a shorter running time( the film almost went for two hours -- or did it just feel like it?) 
, this film might( and i mean* might*) have turned out okay, but as it is, 
 it is stocked with the worst action film cliches, whose only purpose appears to be to pad the film out to its painfully long running time. 
 robert blake, who plays the evil boss, has got to be the most pathetic bad guy in film history! 
 he sounds like wayne newton, and appears to think the best way to appear evil is to have your eyes bulging as though they are about to burst out of their sockets! 
 but this is only one of money train 's problems.

"based on the relatively unknown( in comparison to spider- man) marvel comic book, blade tells the story of half- vampire half- human( played by wesley snipes) who was born of a vampire 's latest meal. 
 now swearing vengeance against all vampires, blade hunts them all. 
 his latest challenge is his biggest though... 
 he must stop the vampire deacon frost( played by stephen dorff) from summoning the blood god and turning the rest of the world into vampires. 
 admitedly, comic books are one of the least appreciated mediums, often viewed as juvenile by most standards, even seen as illiterate by some. 
 judging by a series of poorly recieved( financial and critical) comic book based films( such as batman and robin, steel, barb wire, the crow: city of angels, and the list goes on), one would come to the conclusion that comic books are the worst medium to translate into film. 
 to some degree, i agree with this sentiment. 
 having read comic books since the age of nine( i 'm 21 right now) 
 i can count the number of good comic book based movies( not including japanese manga) one hand: 1: the crow( 1994), 2: batman( 1989), 3: superman, 4: the mask, and now,# 5, blade. 
("" men in black"" is not on this list because it is an extreme deviation from the original comic book) why is this? 
 for the most part, it is because the filmmakers understand the comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match. 
 the crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere, which the director provided. 
 the mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics, which the casting and cg effects reflect. 
 superman is not over the top with colour and flash, and the film reflects this. 
 blade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film, creating an appropriate atmosphere.

"ladies and gentlemen, payback is the most expensive episode of"" the equalizer"" i 've ever seen. 
 gibson plays porter, a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife( deborah kara unger, in an all- too- brief cameo) and partner( henry) after a successful heist. 
 as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porter 's back, porter miraculously springs back to life. 
 he makes it his mission, as a walking dead man without a conscience, to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot. 
( in a running gag, porter demands$ 70 000, but everybody mishears him and assumes he 's after the entire$ 130 000 haul.) in his travels( or travails), porter encounters several other one- named villainous cretins like fairfax( james coburn as a white- haired, millionaire thief) and carter( kristofferson, as a brown- haired, millionaire thief- the kingpin of the obligatory"" operation""). 
 helgeland 's film( which was recut by mel the producer) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm. 
 the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly: a) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs, and b) because mel 's schtick does n't evolve from act one- he 's the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci- fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone.

"i want to be involved in show business one day. 
 and i refuse to do any sequels to any movie i may make because i believe they only get worse. 
 this movie proves it for me. 
 i was a little worried about the last batman film, 
 as i thought joel schumaccer, taking over from tim burton, would screw it up. 
 i also assumed val kilmer would screw up as bruce wayne. 
 they did n't. 
 kilmer did a good job, and the cast was left to carry the movie, which they did( even jim carrey as the riddler and i ca n't stand jim carrey), because schumaccer messed up the direction with his glitzy gotham and his awkward camera angles. 
 this film is different. 
 the cast is still impressive, but here, 
 not only does schumaccer mess up with the direction 
( he 's one of those directors who 's good with actors, terrible with camera angles), but writer akiva goldsmith does n't really give an impressive cast anything to do. 
 the cast is impressive: clooney is a surprisingly good wayne/ batman, o'donnell is a crafty robin as usual, they could 've casted somebody better as batgirl( my friend likes neve campbell), but silverstone is not bad, and thurman is a good poison ivy. 
 the major problem is schwarzenegger, who is a terrible freeze.

"every year, hollywood crowns a new"" it boy"" --a 
 young actor pegged for major movie stardom. 
 inheriting the mantle from last year 's"" winner,"" matthew mcconaughey, is matt damon, and, like mcconaughey, he proves to be more than just a fresh young face, as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release -- john grisham 's the rainmaker and good will hunting. 
 damon has his first major starring role, a la mcconaughey, in a john grisham adaptation -- in this case, francis ford coppola 's take on the rainmaker. 
 damon plays wet- behind- the- ears attorney rudy baylor, who, immediately after passing the bar exam, finds himself representing the mother( mary kay place) of a terminally ill young man( john whitworth) in a big- league suit against a negligent insurance company. 
 while rudy 's( and the film 's) main concern is this case, he also finds time to protect a young wife( claire danes) from her abusive husband( melrose placer andrew shue, in a mercifully brief role). 
 written for the screen and directed by coppola, the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet 
 mostly because it does not take itself too seriously. 
 coppola 's most notable -- and effective -- contribution to the tried- and- true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself, which largely comes in the presence of danny devito( as rudy 's unlicensed co- counsel) and golden globe nominee jon voight( as the insurance company 's hotshot attorney). 
 the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous, but danes is as superb as always. 
 then, of course, there is damon, who nicely juggles the weighty( the insurance case, the spousal abuse) and the humorous( rudy 's often comical naivete) requirements of his role without missing a beat. as good as he is in the rainmaker, damon showcases the depth of his talent in good

"as any reasonable human being would, i must admit that occasionally i am befuddled by certain things. 
 i am befuddled by fight club. 
 now sometimes our favorite films are panned by critics and do not achieve critical success until much later, sometimes as much as ten or twenty years later. 
 perhaps it is because these films are way ahead of their time. 
 perhaps it is because they are so new and complex that only after years of allowing them to sink in 
 do we truly appreciate and understand them. 
 fight club is either garbage or brilliant, but, at least right now, i must lean toward the former.

"adam sandler turns up the charm in his latest romantic comedy, the wedding singer. 
 unfortunately, that also has the effect of softening his edge. 
 he 's nowhere near his peak of happy gilmore, not that it was much of one. 
 he 's certainly not helped here by a rather frail plot. 
 the year is 1985, letting the whole film obsess with 80s nostalgia. 
 adam sandler is nice guy robbie, the titular wedding singer, who entertains at the local reception hall by belting out his interpretations of classic 80s hits. 
 robbie 's life is thrown into turmoil when his fiancee, linda( angela featherstone), leaves him at the altar. 
 however, things are looking up when he meets julia( drew barrymore), a waitress at the hall. 
 she 's the perfect woman, but for one small flaw: she 's engaged to be married to a slick junk bond king, glenn( matthew glave). 
 so, most of the film deals with the slow realization by robbie that he and julia are in love, and his attempts to stop the wedding. 
 as far as plots go, it 's a pretty thin and tired one. to fill the gaps, the wedding singer delivers heaping spoonfuls of 1980s nostalgia. 
 from boy george to michael jackson, from miami vice to dallas, from the first cds to the last rubik 's cubes, this film revels in all the minutiae. 
 and then there 's the music. 
.. 
 learning a lesson from the successful soundtracks to grosse pointe blank, and romy and michele 's high school reunion, this film packs more 80s songs in the film than the running time will allow. 
 as a result, most songs get maybe a lyric or a half, but you can almost see the bright gleam in the record executives' eyes: the wedding singer vols.

 while the nonstop 80s riffs get incredibly tiring, at least they distract you from the plot.

"the ultimate match up between good and evil,"" the untouchables"" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry. 
 based on the 1959 television show of the same title,"" the untouchables"" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place, but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences, some excellent acting, a memorable score, and a clever script. 
 the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public. 
 elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order. 
 however, as ness soon learns, in order to stabilize peace, you have to bend a few laws. 
 the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes. 
 the film begins with capone, played perfectly by deniro, declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws. 
 the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone 's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl. 
 from this point we know capone is evil, not only because he kills without hesitation, but also because he is a lying bastard. 
 right from the first five minutes of the film, de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs. 
 this developed hatred is before the film 's hero, ness, is even introduced.

 after a trek into the cretaceous period, homer observes that any minor alteration made there will erupt into a starling chain of events and seriously modify the present world.

"eric rohmer 's"" pauline at the beach,"" is one of those small, deliberately paced, but charming foreign films in which not much happens plot wise, but a lot happens to the characters emotionally. 
 the film takes place during a few weeks of august at the normandy coast, and centers on six different characters, primarily pauline( amanda langlet), a wise beyond her years 15-year- old who has come to stay for the summer with her older cousin, marion( arielle dombasle). 
 on the first day at the beach, marion runs into an old high school flame( fedoore atkine), and although he wants to rekindle their relationship, she is more interested in an older, more seductive womanizer( pascal greggory), who is also secretly having an affair with a candy vendor( rosette). 
 while pauline watches as an outsider at what is happening between all of the adults, she forms a relationship of her own with a young teenage boy( simon de la brosse). 
"" pauline at the beach,"" is not a film in which big dramatic things occur, and there is not a clear- cut, tidy conclusion to the story. 
 instead, it is a picture that simply observes its characters in every day life, and the surprises come from little character details. 
 the film is quite talky and slow moving, and so it is pretty safe to say it is n't for those who are only a fan of action movies, but is a treat for those viewers who often like to venture outside of the big- budget genre and see a good art film. 
 this is the first film by acclaimed director eric rohmer( 1969 's"" my night at mauds,"" and 1971 's"" claire 's knee"") that i have seen, but his direction is assured and intelligent, as is the screenplay, which he also wrote.

" knock off"" is exactly that: 
 a cheap knock off of an action movie. 
 it 's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year. 
 i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998, but alas, it has already been found. 
 jean- claude van damme stars as( i think) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half- brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods. 
 rob schneider plays van damme 's partner, and rochon plays... 
 actually, i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be. 
 she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there. 
 many things are not explained in this film, but i do know that for some bizarre reason, van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick. 
 where chan comes off as endearing in his"" normal guy"" character seen in many of his films, van damme 
 just comes off as a wimp. 
 we 're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions. 
 to be more clear: i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie, and even then, it was not made too clear. 
 the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong. 
 tsui hark( who directed van damme 's last movie, the bad, but not nearly as bad as this,"" double team"") never lets the camera rest for a second, and that 's no exaggeration. 
 we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme 's foot entering a shoe.

"it 's been a long time since walt disney has delivered us a classic along the lines of the little mermaid or beauty and the beast. 
 sure, there have been delightful outings like last years hercules. 
 but nothing entirely groundbreaking. 
 with the release of the studio 's newest feature length film, a remake of edgar rice burrough 's creation tarzan, disney has plunged into new waters with both maturity and animation techniques. 
 it 's no classic, but this new tarzan represents exactly what a family film should be 
. 
 the plot is loyal to the original storyline, as tarzan 's parents are forced to abandon their ship which has caught fire, and find shelter in the jungles of africa. 
 but, they are killed( offscreen) by the snarling cheetah sabor, leaving baby tarzan alone and unharmed in his crib. 
 found by kala( voiced with effective gentleness by glenn close), a kindhearted mother and member of a gorilla pack, tarzan is taken into the primate group and raised as one of their own. 
 we follow the young boy through the years, as he partakes in various adventures with his loud mouth gorilla friend terk( a very brash but funny rosie o'donnell) and clumsy elephant tantor( wayne knight). 
 of course, in any disney film we are given some kind of goofy sidekick or humorous chum for the hero. in tarzan, these characters fill that space rather inconspicuously. 
 gags that were magnified in other family films are kept quite minor here. 
 most of the characters are amusing without being forced. 
 as tarzan grows to manhood, the suspected antagonist stumbles into the picture. 
 here, the notorious bad guy is the big game hunter clayton( brian blessed), who 's accompanying a hapless professor( nigel hawthorne) on an expedition through the jungle. 
 of course, there 's the professor 's daughter, jane( nicely vocalized by a cheerful minnie driver) who will help supply the romantic quotient of the movie. 
 the thing that blew my socks off about this version of tarzan is the stunning animation",positive,The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the maturity and animation techniques of the film. They also commend the loyalty of the plot to the original storyline and the amusing characters.

"wesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles. 
 murder at 1600, u. s. 
 marshals, money train, drop zone, boiling point, and the ultimate camp film- passenger 57. 
 the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category. 
 ultimately, it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report, ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe, and terrible acting by b- list actors like michael biehn and anne archer. 
 oddly, it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes"" masterpiece,"" rising sun. 
 the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador, the chinese triad brotherhood, a rich chinese businessman( played by? 
 that bad guy from rising sun, cary- hiroyuki tagawa) 
 a chinese un interpreter, and, inexplicably, donald sutherland. 
 the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island. 
 or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woo 's hong kong films combined. 
 i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film. 
 i usually enjoy snipes' movies- though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films. 
 simply, i am amazed by the how inane the script was, filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences. 
 director christian duguay( screamers) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains, people impaled with broken shards of glass, and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere. 
 it also sickens me to know that oliver stone, one of the greatest directors working today, had his hand in producing this monstrosity. 
 i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its poor selection of roles, unbelievable plot, excessive violence, and bad acting.

"i do n't expect much from eddie murphy these days. 
 for the past four years, the gods of cinema -- or the expansive payrolls of studio conglomerates -- have allowed him to make one bad movie after another. 
 such films as metro, doctor dolittle, holy man, life, and bowfinger have reduced a once great comedic persona to a living and breathing washed- up hack performing as a studio puppet for 20th century fox and universal pictures. 
 the biggest shame to fall on his shoulders is his newest film, nutty professor ii: the klumps. 
 the klumps once again revisits the life of sherman klump, an overweight university science professor looking for love in all the wrong places. 
 sherman has just invented a new"" youth drink"" that enables man or beast to become younger for a short period of time. 
 janet jackson is the love interest who chooses the lovable sherman for a soul mate rather than excel at her career as a university professor( and for the most ridiculous reasons). 
 with love on his mind, sherman is determined to rid himself of his alter ego, buddy love from the first professor, who still resides with vigor inside his psyche and causes sherman to act like a bad imitation of vince vaughn from swingers. 
 with some convoluted mumbo- jumbo about dna extraction, sherman extracts the"" buddy love"" link in his dna and smartly deposits buddy into a handy- dandy lab beaker. 
 but one night, the beaker is knocked over and buddy love is regenerated... 
 because every movie like this needs an unnecessary villain to thwart the good guy. 
 then the klump family, all played by eddie murphy, step in for some comedic relief involving old people having sex, flabby breasts, a slew of fart and dick jokes, and enough fat people jokes that i lost count after the first thirty minutes.

 the movie finally dissolves into a really bad hallmark family special about realizing who you are and what you can",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes Eddie Murphy's recent movies, including the one being reviewed.

" 
 the fugitive"" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made. 
 it takes realistic, believable characters and tells an exciting story 
 that 's totally believable throughout. 
 this is n't an over- the- top action flick for the sake of action, this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and 
 it works perfectly. 
 harrison ford stars as dr. 
 richard kimble, a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife. 
 the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder, but is not told in a straightforward manner. 
 we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble 's perspective. 
 hints are dropped from various times of the night kimble 's wife, helen( sela ward) was murdered. 
 we do n't get to see who the killer is until much further into the story. 
 in fact, we might even have a little doubt about kimble 's innocence ourselves. 
 the film does n't spend much time on the details of kimble 's trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story. 
 one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck. 
 but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated 
, it is actually suspenseful to watch. 
 this movie is so incredible because it 's able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable. 
 tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard, a u. s. 
 marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives. 
 from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur. 
 kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other. 
 most of the film deals with richard 's complex investigation as he tries to find the one- armed man who killed his wife. 
 ford does not have a lot of lines here, so it is stuart and twohy 's script",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the movie for its believable characters and story. They appreciate the suspense and mystery in the movie, and commend the performances of Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones.

"i came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor, an innocuous- enough- on- the- surface romantic comedy. 
 it 's not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity, but there it was nonetheless. 
 i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999. 
 in a word, it 's the same thing that 's wrong with so many movies circa 1999: writing. 
 more to the point, it 's the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when you 're telling a story about a relationship. 
 the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where we 're expected to get dewy- eyed over any pairing of attractive, pleasant people just because they 're attractive and pleasant. 
 in this particular case, attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon( chris o'donnell), a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage. 
 it 's a scary notion for jimmy, even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne( renee zellweger), his girlfriend of three years. 
 convinced despite his reservations that it 's time to"" sh 
* t or get off the pot,"" jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly. 
 anne refuses, which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather( peter ustinov) dies and leaves a very specific video will. 
 jimmy stands to inhereit$ 100 million if he is married by 6 
: 05 p. 
 m. 
 on his 30th birthday, stays married for 10 years and produces a child. 
 there are only a couple of minor problems: 1) jimmy 's 30th birthday is the next day; 2) anne is nowhere to be found, meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex- girlfriends. 
 it 's a wacky, brewster 's millions- esque premise( acknowledged as such in one of the film 's better, more self- aware",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its poor writing and lack of character development.

 nothing short of hiring a new cast, a more literate screenwriter, and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson 's meritorious novel. 
 the haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy, and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects do n't frighten so much as numb the audience into submission

"" fragile nell( taylor), bisexual theo( zeta- jones), and smiley luke( wilson) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders, hosted by professor marrow( neeson). 
 marrow 's secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house 's bleak history. 
 he 's not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew, nell especially, who has some ancestral connection to the manor 's previous inhabitants. 
 taylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big- budget lead. 
 for starters, her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes, when we 're introduced to the mansion and all its fun- house trappings. 
 her character is supposed to be depressed, having tended to an unloving mother for too many years, but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame, alternately grouchy, mopey, wiggy and pathetic, and i kept wondering why the other characters did n't just ditch this bitch

"america loves convenience. 
 after all, we 're the culture that invented the cell phone, the 24-hour atm, and my most beloved, the remote control. 
 yet perhaps this time, with ghosts of mars, we have taken our love of convenience to far. 
 ghosts of mars stars natasha henstridge as a tough as nails, pill- poppin', martian cop, sent with her squadron to retrieve"" demolition"" williams( ice cube) from a remote mining town for trial back home. 
 when she and her comrades, appropriately dubbed"" the commander,"""" the rookies,"" and the guy with the cool accent discover the town 's residents slaughtered, they are forced to team up with williams to escape from the remaining residents' head- chopping, alien- possessed clutches. 
 filled with a lovely overuse of storytelling flashbacks, flashes- sideways, and viewpoint changes, ghosts of mars is a hapless mishmash of poorly constructed dialogue and ill- conceived action sequences. 
 the only thing keeping this film from becoming an incomprehensible mess is the sheer idiotic simplicity of its story. 
 ripped straight from the pages of a 1970s zombie movie, ghosts leaps from one convenient moment to the next, stopping only to kill the characters which are most convenient to lose. 
 attempts at character interaction and development are rare and forced. 
 most of these moments come off as kwik- e- mart wisdom, dispensed heartily around the slushee machine of life by the even- tempered streetwise hand of ice cube. 
 with a gun in one hand and a dynamite cap in the other, cube reminisces about his street life, comparing the zombie- stomping fun to"" me and my brother when we was kids. 
"" 
 apparently, crime in the bronx has gotten so bad that the residents have actually taken to ritually decapitating one another for entertainment.

 one can only hope they were rewarded handsomely for acting in this hopelessly muddled picture. 
 besides the obvious hardships of acting most scenes while dog paddling in the water, they will all receive black marks on their records for appearing in this dismal movie. 
 graham yost 's script serves up one cliche after another for the actors, who thankfully managed to mumble quite a few of the lines.

 you send out self- replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information. 
 it may take decades, centuries, or millennia, but it can be done with achievable technology, and does n't require a magical faster- than- light drive. in the fifties, british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer, which would then engage in a real- time dialog with the aliens, exchanging information and technologies, and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned.

"this summer, one of the most racially charged novels in john grisham 's series, a time to kill, was made into a major motion picture. 
 on january 3 of this year, director rob reiner basically re- released the film under the title of ghosts of mississippi.

 de la beckwith( james woods, casino) jailed. 
 so she turns to assistant district attorney and prosecutor bobby delaughter( alec baldwin, heaven 's prisoners) to imprison the former kkk member.

 when i bought the soundtrack, i was really quite surprised at how different it sounded from most disney features. 
 i have never really heard of phil collins, nor have i heard of mark mancina, so i was wondering, how would these two make this disney flick spin? 
 i was pleasantly surprised: the music is top- notch. 
 phil collins' songs are terrific, percussion- heavy pieces of work that seem to break the formula for typical disney songs. 
 the score from mark mancina was also neat

 when comparing this movie to the fugitive, the prequel is far superior. 
 but even on it 's own, u. s 
 marshals is a pretty lousy movie. 
 while the original was reasonably intelligent, and had a fugitive to root for, the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive, mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film 's overlong running time. 
 while the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character, u. s 
 marshals is straight in there, pulling it 's trump card( the place crash) almost immediately.

"synopsis: melissa, a mentally- disturbed woman who likes to smoke, seduces doug, a minor- league baseball player who likes to study anatomy, work on motorcycles, and make out with his girlfriend in a public library. 
 when doug decides to stop seeing her, melissa maliciously takes revenge on those around him, including his girlfriend, his mother, and his cat. 
 comments: malicious, i suppose, is an acceptable moview for what it is: a cheap, b- movie thriller which rips off dozens and dozens of spurned- psycho- lover- who- wants- revenge films 
( like fatal attraction, hand that rocks the cradle, etc. etc.) that have come before it. 
 malicious, however, really does n't provide very many particularly suspenseful moments. 
 the plot starts off energetically enough, the main characters are introduced and the affair between doug and melissa begins and ends pretty early on in the film. 
 it starts to drag, unfortunately, after this. 
 melissa will obviously try to take her revenge on doug( as always seems to happen in movies like these), but she does so in unimaginative ways that have been done in other, better thrillers before.

 these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york( where, i suppose, they thought they would n't be noticed). 
 this brother, mikhail suverov( played in his few scenes by... 
 well, you know), becomes deeply involved in the russian mafia and the fbi( almost the same thing, i guess), and is killed in france( in the movie, things happen so fast that you do n't have too much time to think about how weird this all is). 
 moreau does what any good surviving twin brother would do and goes to new york to find out why mikhail was killed, and why everyone in france who knows anything about him is also being killed( we wonder the same thing; i still do). 
 in little odessa, he meets mikhail 's girlfriend, alex( natasha henstridge, last seen in species), who helps him solve the mystery and adds immeasurably to the mise- en- scene( she has very nice breasts, and we get to seen them briefly in this movie; it was rated r in the us but is pg here, so they must have seen more of her breasts than we do). 
 this film lacks the gloss and high production values of such other action movies as broken",positive,The review is positive because it praises the movie for its fast-paced plot and the performance of Jean-Claude Van Damme. The reviewer also appreciates the contribution of Natasha Henstridge to the mise-en-scene.

 writer- director john herzfeld 's two days in the valley falls into the latter category. 
 weaving together a grabbag of seemingly unrelated characters

 hitmen lee( james spader) and his partner dosmo( danny aiello) pop a guy in bed while leaving his drugged wife becky fox( teri hatcher) lying next to him showing the audience where on her behind 
 she got nicely pricked. 
 an understandeably shocked becky runs out of the house the next morning before hailing down a couple of vice cops,( jeff daniels) and wes( eric stoltz). 
 a murder is not vice territory, flirting with asian prostitues is, but wes would rather play inquisitive detective. 
 meanwhile, washed- up director, teddy( paul mazursky) is about to end his life. 
 but before he can do that, he must find a good home for his dog. 
 enter nurse audrey( marsha mason), who takes the dog and teddy for a ride. 
 stuffy art dealer, allan hopper( greg cruttwell) has kidney stones. 
 while struggling about his fancy house, he switches between moaning in self- pity and dropping condescending hints about his loyal secretary 's( glenne headly) plain appearance. 
 do n't be surprised if you find yourself asking more than once just what the hell is going on. 
 you might like that feeling of cluelessness. 
 herzfeld does answer all the questions in the course of time and pieces it all rather neatly in the last five minutes. 
 the jigsaw puzzle assembled is n't stunning by any means though. 
 the characters lack the stature or moral complexity of altman 's real- life heroes in short cuts, even though they are interesting and funny.

 the irony of this statement will not be lost on audience members who have not yet walked out, fallen asleep, or otherwise given up on this pathetic attempt at romantic comedy. 
 the film is a multi- million dollar testament to everything artificial. 
 filled with characters, motivation, plot and dialogue that ring fake and shallow at every step

 prinze plays a college student intent on playing the field until he falls for stiles' freshman co- ed.

 then, in standard romantic comedy style, things fall apart. 
 why? 
 well, because they have to. 
 otherwise the couple ca n't make up and live( presumably) happily ever after. 
 down to you exists outside the realm of normal logic. 
 scenes do not connect to each other and it often seems to be attempting some sort of surrealism, but this is handled so poorly that everything comes off random and stupid instead. 
 a picnic scene involving the six key characters is just bizarre, not only for the stretched logic of these people hanging out together, or even knowing each other, but mostly because an unusual amount of screen time is dedicated to a goat. 
 the supporting characters are remarkably flat, and insultingly ridiculous as well.

 shortly thereafter, he begins to sing"" time is on my side"" as he 's taken on his last walk. 
 minutes later, the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead. 
 but for hobbes, the nightmare is just beginning, because reese was n't a normal psychopath? 
 he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel. 
 and, with reese 's death, azazel is free to hop from body to body, murdering and wreaking havoc at will. 
 only hobbes and a pretty, female theology teacher( embeth davidtz) have an inkling of what they 're up against. 
 the rest of the cops, including hobbes' partner, jonesy( john goodman); lou( james gandolfini), a newcomer to the department; and lieutenant stanton( donald sutherland), do n't have a clue, and, as a result, they are in mortal danger.

 during a wedding, the groom is flirting with some tramp, and in an attempt to to prevent a scene, his mother in law, played by irma p. hall, comes to the rescue. 
 the way in which she does this makes me think irma p. hall is one of the greatest actresses around right now. 
 however, this is just one magical moment in a movie filled with them. 
 vanessa williams, vivica fox, and nia long star as three sisters who have each gone their own way in life. 
 williams is teri, a successful lawyer, who is frustrated by her husband miles attempts at a music career. 
 fox is maxine, the strongest of the sisters, which can be confirmed by the stability of her marriage and the wisdom of her son ahmad, who narrates the film. 
 long is bird, a hairdresser who is the last of the three to get married. 
 her husband lem is an intense passionate individual whose temper gets the best of him sometime but never stops loving.

 in fact, i predicted who it would be before the movie began and was correct in my preliminary suspicions.

 annie wilson( cate blanchett) is a recently widowed mother of three sons who makes her living giving psychic readings to the residents of her backwater southern hometown.

 for annie, she does not give the readings merely for money, but uses it as a way of seeking solace in finding the good in everyone 's future. 
 her late grandmother( rosemary harris) told her as a child that it was a gift she was given, and she should always remember that.

"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year. 
 earlier this may, leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top- rated miniseries that debuted on cbs. 
 and now, director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies. 
 starring milla jovovich, who is predominantly unconvincing 
 as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch,` the messenger: the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re- enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend. 
 besson( who 's previous work includes the hyperactive sci- fi` the fifth element') perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex- wife jovovich, because in` the messenger', the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience. 
 at first, when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role, i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber. 
 after seeing the rousing trailer, my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed- milla jovovich looked superb. 
 with the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance,` the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making. 
 a timeless epic 
 it is not. 
 besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style, and the story behind` the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands. 
 on the shoulders of besson 's choppy and unexciting direction, the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery. 
 there is no human exploration into the character of joan( or jeanne). 
 jovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective. 
 jovivich 's unsatisfying portrayal

 she is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast.

 the film, disney 's 25th animated feature, opens with a menacing shot of a great black cauldron unshrouded by mist as a narrator begins to tell the tale: a long time ago in the land of prydain, there was a king so evil, that his spirit was captured in the cauldron.

"it 's no secret in the motion picture industry that the relationship between a script and the actors involved often makes or breaks a movie at the box office. 
 a poorly- written script can be bested by a superb acting corps, and a well- written piece can be mangled by a group of amateurs. 
 in directing his latest action- comedy, director brett ratner( money talks) takes a relatively mediocre piece of standup comedy and turns it into a funny as all get- out buddy cop movie. 
 in addition, rush hour serves as a first- class example of directing a movie with conservative attitude- a feature that is sure to draw in crowds of all types. 
 the two lead names share equal screen time here, mostly because they spend it together. 
 jackie chan, in his first completely american production, makes an impressive debut by mixing dialogue with martial arts. 
 the other martial arts flick from a few weeks ago, knock off, stands no chance against the content of this one. 
 chan manages to make every fight scene exude grace and poise, and there 's no doubt that a large percentage of video sales for this movie will come from viewers who could n't believe their eyes the first time.

 of course, the last one was n't very great or anything 
( i liked it, though not as much as the first two), and more importantly, it was n't financially successful( a tawdry 55 million bucks!)

 so back we are, with ripley back as a clone, which means we get another little satirical look at cloning( not that that 's a bad thing, but it 's becoming a cliche).

 wren, played by j.

 the story begins with edward douglas( thewlis), a un representative sent to oversee a peace treaty somewhere in the south pacific, who is saved from the brink of death by montgomery( kilmer) after his plane crashes into the sea. 
 douglas soon learns that montgomery is working for dr. 
 moreau, who incidently, owns the island and also a reputable geneticist who has been awarded the nobel prize.

"august and september are a wasteland when it comes to children 's films, and october is a dumping ground for munchkin movies the studios do n't want to see slaughtered against family- oriented thanksgiving films.

"last summer, a feature- length version of the avengers hit theaters to the tune of a unanimous critical panning. 
 based on the famous 60 's television show, the film was an enormous box- office flop and a huge disappointment for warner bros. 
 a year later, the studio is up to their old tricks again, with the unnecessary revival of the robert conrad program the wild, wild west. 
 but it sounded promising: the same tag- team of star will smith and director barry sonnenfeld, who both contributed to make men in black such a financial success, is at the reins again. 
 and co- star kevin kline is attached to the project, as well as a substantial budget to spice up the special effects. 
 i mean, what could possibly go wrong? 
 the answer is just about everything. 
 wild wild west is a cinematic abomination- a film that was so entirely pointless to begin with that it is never given a proper chance to get out of the gate 
. 
 there are a lot of fancy special effects, and a handful of distinguished actors who try desperately to tunnel through the inane plot and make a lasting impression. 
 but the script is so deliriously uneven, the entire movie so off course, that no human being or technical achievement has a chance to salvage it. 
 at square one, we have a bizarre case of casting. 
 will smith plays james west, a renegade cowboy who was originally played by white actor robert conrad in the tv series. 
 my guess regarding the casting of african- american smith is a simple one: the actor+ a cozy summertime release= big bucks for all those involved. 
 smith is a very talented performer who usually brings swift assurance to any comic relief material, but this is not an ideal role for him.

" gattaca"" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science- fiction films -- it 's a genre picture that does n't rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story. 
 the movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction. 
 this allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color, intelligence and life span 
 they 'd like for their child, and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects. 
 those made the old- fashioned way are labeled as"" in- valids"" and confined to the lower rung of society. 
 vincent freeman( ethan hawke) is one such person, born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish- molded younger brother anton. 
 fed up with being second- rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space, vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation. 
 everyday, he watches as"" superior"" folk make his fantasy a reality. 
 determined to do the same, vincent meets a dna broker( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo) who sells fake identities to in- valids. 
 his counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow( jude law), an ex- athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life. 
 for a price and the promise of a caretaker, jerome supplies vincent with his identity, as well as blood, skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on- the- job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card. 
 because of his drastically improved status, vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca, and catches the eye of comely co- worker irene( uma thurman) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect, she 's enamored by his flawless persona

"talk about a movie that seemed dated before it even hit the theaters! 
 spice world is the feature film debut of the pre- fabricated pop band, the spice girls. 
 it 's intended as a sort of hard day 's night, but ends up simply hard to watch. 
 when watching the spice girls, i 'm reminded of an old saturday morning cartoon trick( such as from the smurfs, the snorks, or teenage mutant ninja turtles) in which identically animated creatures are differentiated into characters merely by one personality quirk and a different name. 
 the spice girls are themselves as interchangable as pringles, and about as talented. 
 there 's ginger( geri halliwell), the brainy one, sporty( melanie chisholm), the athletic one, baby( emma bunton), the childish one, posh( victoria adams), the fashion- conscious one, and scary( melanie brown), the one with a tongue pierced back

 the film itself does n't really have a plot. 
 it follows the girls as they travel here and there, culminating at their"" first live performance"" at albert hall. 
 the action, however, seems more like a hodgepodge of mismatched ideas. 
 the various misfires include: an alien encounter, a fiendish tabloid editor scheming to wreck the spice girls, the shooting of a spice girls documentary, a movie producer( george wendt) trying to pitch various ideas for a spice girls movie( nearly all of which, though incredibly far fetched, seem more plausible than the mess with which they ended up), a meeting with a pregnant friend( whose sole purpose seems to be to maintain the film maxim that all pregnant characters must give birth before the movie ends), a boating adventure, a bus race, club- hopping( wherein apparently no one notices the famous spice girls among the crowd...

"what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable, lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project. 
 most of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films. 
 john frankenheimer, who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60 's, recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin. 
 screenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd. 
 ben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room, and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes. 
 even charlize theron, who i was convinced could n't act, did a decent job in cider house rules. 
 when all of these bright stars come together, one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining. 
 after coming out of the theater showing reindeer games, disbelief was my first reaction? 
 then frustration. 
 the movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all- rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining. 
 the acting is so pitiful and the script so dull 
, i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are. 
 it seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights. 
 we have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set, it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar. 
 the actors in that movie were having fun and, from that, the audience had fun.

"the film"" magnolia"" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests. 
 the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower. 
 they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart. 
 the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially. 
 from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host, each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain. 
 they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness. 
 whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse, each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one. 
"" magnolia"" is a clever, well thought out film from prodigy director- writer paul thomas anderson of"" boogie nights"" fame. 
 the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make"" magnolia"" memorable. 
 however, what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories, the film is never confusing. 
 anderson 's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful. 
 he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of"" magnolia 's"" scenes drag on too long. 
 any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending. 
 from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just does n't get boring

 it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot. 
 this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation.

"play it to the bone, 
 the newest addition to ron shelton 's sports- themed repertoire fails in numerous ways. 
 like most of shelton 's other great films( bull durham, white men ca n't jump) 
, this dud unsuccessfully attempts to use athleticism as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots. 
 shelton 's films are not considered sports films, but they do heavily revolve around a specific game to tell a story. 
 shelton has been so good in the past at using sports to analyze the structure of society that from his collection of films we are given an examination of different classes and races living in various different regions. 
 play it to the bone is unsuccessful because not only is the boxing theme dull, but the side story of the two guys and a girl travelling across the country is even worse. 
 the film has no social message like its predecessors. 
 the relationship between the friends, two failed boxers who must face off against each other in the ring for 50 thousand dollars, is very confusing for a number of reasons. 
 the whole film, since it is primarily a"" buddy picture,"" depends on the strength of the friendship the two characters have for each other. 
 unfortunately, it is a very weak bond for the reasons listed below. 
 1) 
 we never see how cesar( antonio banderas) and vince( woody harrelson) meet. 
 the two are so different from each other, that a scene of how this odd friendship developed should have been mandatory. 
 2) vince and cesar argue every moment possible on their trip to las vegas.

 there are some sight gags that pop up as well, such as mona 's tombstone, which reads"" demoted"", instead of devoted.

 it 's up to wayne and 
 j. d. to rescue their best friend in"" saving silverman."" 
"" silverman"" has its heart in the right place, but the story, by newcomers hank nelken and greg depaul, is too lightweight to sustain the tale of the battle for darren 's soul. 
 based on their experience of a friend making a major marital mistake, the story is centered on the three, life long amigos. 
 when wayne introduces darren to judith, he does n't realize that he has opened a pandora 's box of disaster for himself and j.

"this movie tries to present itself as the sequel to jan de bont 's debut as a director, 1994 surprise hit speed. 
 but the only thing the two movies have in common is sandra bullock as the female lead. 
 annie( sandra bullock) is in the wrong place at the wrong time again. 
 she 's going on a cruise with her new boy- friend alex( jason patric), and of course it is her ship that is kidnapped by john geiger( willem dafoe) who has a bone to pick with the shipping line. 
 they sacked him after he got sick. 
 now he wants the diamonds stored in the ship 's safe for compensation. 
 that actually is the whole storyline. 
 speed 2 could do without dialogues. 
 the movie is all about images and remarkable sound. 
 i do n't really know why this is called an action movie. except for a few scenes that are vaguely reminiscent of speed this goes along the lines of the desaster movies of the 70ies. 
 first we are introduced to a number of people who are going to be important later on in the movie. 
 then desaster strikes. 
 sandra bullock was said to have been glad that she could take action this time around. 
 i looked for the"" action"" but could n't find it.

 the only time she is part of what happens is when she can have a shot at defusing a bomb and freeing some passengers trapped behind a fire door. 
 now we know that she can handle a chain saw. 
 we also know that fire doors on cruise ships can be cut apart in seconds. 
 the bomb defusal of course goes wrong, but only the furniture is damaged, not our heroes who still are needed.

 he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment. 
 his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3- 5 year stretch in new hampshire, something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he does n't think he could survive prison at his age.

 he and his dim- witted brother jacob( thorton) and tubby friend lou( brent briscoe) come upon a large bag of cash inside a plane wreck. 
 against his better judgement, hank decides to go along with the idea of keeping it rather than going to the authorities. 
 the rest of the film is a question of who is going to die to keep this a secret, and is it worth it? 
 a simple wish lies along the lines of very bad things, clay pigeons and even fargo, and is kind of wrapped all into one little dark bundle.

 and its much better than any of those. 
 sam raimi took a departure from his normal freak- show horror- monkey films and made this stylish and intriguing picture. 
 he really lets the audience sit back and watch the events unfold rather than force them down our throats as many directors prefer to do. 
 i think raimi knew he had a winner on his hands and decided to direct the picture on a natural flowing course. 
 one of the film 's components can be linked to a recurring theme in terrence malick 's the thin red line. 
 in malick 's three hour bore- a- thon, he makes an interesting attempt to link mother earth to his war story. 
 it seemed nothing more than an occasional pretty cut to a field of flowing grass, a small bird, or a flowing body of water.

"the party is one of those classic slapstick comedies that will leave you, at times, cracking up. 
 the film takes place, for the most part, in real- time during an exclusive evening party that is attended only by the biggest names in hollywood. 
 hrundi v. 
 bakshi, played very well by peter sellers, is a struggling actor who just came to america from his homeland, india. 
 hrundi tries out his acting talents, but it seems that he just is n't cut out for the job. 
 on the set of his current film that he stars in, hrundi seems to make everything go for the worse. 
 during the filming of this movie set in the 1800 's, hrundi manages to annoy the director( herbert ellis) in any way he can. this includes a pitiful acting job in many scenes, wearing an underwater watch in one scene, and accidentally detonating a massive set. 
 many of the hollywood producers and big names want hrundi out of the business forever. 
 and when the director makes a personal phone call to mr. 
 clutterbuck( j. edward mckinley) 
 pleading for hrundi 's ejection from hollywood, everything is pretty much over for hrundi. 
 clutterbuck writes his name down on a piece of paper to insure that hrundi will never again work in hollywood. 
 but when this piece of paper turns out to be the guest list for clutterbuck 's exclusive party, hrundi is invited, and certain chaos is bound to occur. 
 of course, as predicted, hrundi causes lots of trouble. 
 each scene in which hrundi encounters a situation, usually one that he ca n't handle, is almost always very humorous. 
 and each scene with hrundi and the drunken waiter, who is alone hilarious

"the recent onslaught of film noir that has popped up in multiplexes, with everything ranging from"" l. a. confidential"" to"" palmetto"" to"" the big lebowski,"" has proved to be an artistic commodity for veteran, talented directors. 
 with this particular genre, directors are able to collate the sleazy underworld of the lower- class and the glamorous, opulent upper- class, while maintaining the noirish, ambiguous ambience, the staple of film noir. 
"" wild things"" could be classified as a black comedy, a sultry film noir or a plain ol' erotic thriller, but the one category it does n't qualify for is that of a quality motion picture. overacted, overwrought and overlong,"" wild things"" is a confused mess, a movie that wants to have its cake and eat it too. 
 with its incalculable twists, turns, more twists and more turns, it soon becomes a tedious exercise in pointlessness. 
 in spite of game efforts by kevin bacon and matt dillon, who manage to sustain straight faces throughout the ordeal,"" wild things"" not once jells in its eroticism, unpredictability, character motivation, sense of the world, plot, etc.

"only a year after the initial release of"" scream,"" the horror send- up from veteran horror director wes craven and screenwriter kevin williamson that seemed to breathe new life into the slasher genre, the inevitable sequel"" scream 2"" has arrived in our theaters. 
 while the tongue- in- cheek, parodic element is still noticeable in this film, it 's really a sideshow to a broader commentary on violence and the media and a more conventional horror story. 
 the first film, while often violent and gruesome, was mostly lacking in genuine scares because almost every scene was played for camp value and the discussion of the quirks and cliches of horror movies was nearly constant. 
 the premise of"" scream 2"" is that a series of copycat killings begin when a movie called"" stab,"" based on a book written by opportunistic reporter gail weathers( courtney cox) about the events in"" scream,"" is released and two audience members are killed during the opening screening. 
 i had heard about this scene before i went to see the film and was surprised to find this sequence largely lacking in camp comedy. 
 its conclusion, in which a bleeding, wounded woman stumbles in front of the screen and dies in front of an audience that cheers on because they think it 's a publicity stunt, is more surreal and disturbing than anything else. 
 the satire in"" scream 2"" thus takes on a broad focus and gradually evolves into an exploration of media perceptions in general. 
 although resident horror film geek randy( jamie kennedy) is back with fresh dialogue about sequels( and, interestingly enough, how they are usually inferior to their predecessors), the characters in this movie are drawing from other entries in the pop culture encyclopedia as well.

 if all comedies( or even half; or-- what am i saying?

 probably because it stars corey haim, or maybe because it 's about a little geek who collects insects, or maybe because it does n't feature slick one- liners or the chart topping soundtrack albums that were almost a requirement for teen films in the 80 's. however, you have been missing out on a true masterpeice, the best film of 1986, and the best film about adolescent life ever made. 
 corey haim stars as lucas bligh, a tiny 14 year old with scruffy hair, thick glasses, and an interest in insects and other outdoor life. 
 one day he stops by the tennis courts and sees what must be an angel to him. 
 her name is maggie, a 16 year old who certainly is a beauty, with lovely red hair and a sweet, innocent complexion. 
 maggie seems to be a little disturbed by this little kid watching her, but somehow he interests her, and soon they are talking and getting to know one another. 
 they gradually become good friends, and spend the summer together doing various things, such as studying insects( namely locusts, who come out of hiding once every 17 years), playing tennis, and listening to a symphony orchestra through a manhole cover. 
 lucas is obviously in love with maggie, and while she is charmed by him, it 's clear that she would never consider him anything more than a very good friend.

 in case you 've been asleep for the last few months, the plot centres on truman burbank( carrey) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven. 
 his life seems so perfect, however, because it 's controlled by christoff( harris) creator of the truman show, the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of. 
 that 's right 
, burbank 's life is being broadcast live to the american public, and seahaven and all it 's inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage. 
 the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far... 
 with an idea so different, it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator. 
 luckily, the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages, yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie. 
 talking of carrey, 
 he 's perfect in this movie, enjoying the best role in his career. 
 his character is a re- inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask( 1994) and is completely suited to carrey 's persona.

 its dialog is 
 so stilted-

 in the story, lee plenty( cherot) is a 28-year- old author and teaching assistant. 
 the movie, which happens mainly over the new year 's holiday, consists of a series of incidents in which various single and married women try to kiss lee or take him to bed. since he consistently refuses, caroline gooden( tammi katherine jones) figures that he must be gay.

"walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox 's anastasia. 
 but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios, the visuals are 
 the only thing fox has to brag about. 
 disney 's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and to a lesser extent, hercules. 
 with anastasia, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window.

 don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout, occasionally rivalling photographic quality. 
 and yet in other scenes, the hand- drawn material seems of the saturday- morning tv crowd, which leads me to wonder.

 director paul thomas anderson 's boogie nights offers us a view into the world of porn during the period considered to be the golden age of adult cinema, the mid to late 70s. 
 this was the period when x- rated movies were real movies, shot on film, shown in movie theaters and even reviewed by legitimate critics. 
 this was an age when porn directors actually aspired to make innovative often educational films, films that attempted to tell a real story. 
 one of the more fascinating aspects of this film is how, like in an any other billion dollar industry, the creative visionaries tend to be ignorant to the trends that will soon make them obsolete. 
 in this case, the arrival of the now ubiquitous videocassette. 
 burt reynold 's manages to resuscitate his career portraying such an auteur, known as jack horner. 
 horner 's has a steady"" family"" of performers, some of whom live in his plush l. a. home. 
 but in the world of porn, performers are a commodity- the fresher, the better. 
 when horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque, he decides to add him to his stable. 
 it is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his. as directed by anderson, the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door. 
 boogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l. a. 's hardcore film scene. 
 but the peep show doesnut let us walk away when",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film's depiction of the porn industry during the 70s, the performances, and the director's work.

"titanic is, without a doubt, the best movie i 've seen all year. and believe me, i 'm not an easy critic to impress: the english patient was too long, men in black was over- hyped, and several of the"" big summer releases"" were dead in the water. 
 thank god this film got delayed until december. 
 it 's my christmas present. 
 titanic is in the tradition of the old hollywood epics of years- gone- by, and 
 it is truly a stunning film. 
 while watching this picture you are completely mesmerized, never taking your eyes off the screen, nor checking your watch to see how much longer it 's gon na last, despite its 3 hour plus running time. 
 as a friend of mine, who 's a true titanic- buff, said"" if someone does n't like this film, it 's because they did n't want to."" truer words are hard to come by. 
 of course, it does n't hurt that this film comes from one of my favorite directors, james cameron, who is unarguably the greatest action director of all time. 
 if you wish to argue that point with me, look at his list of credits: the terminator, aliens, the abyss, terminator 2, true lies, etc. 
 still care to disagree? 
 not only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film, he also wrote, produced, and edited it. and to show his true faith for the project, he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs. 
 it 's obvious he truly loves titanic

"it is movies like these that make a jaded movie viewer thankful for the invention of the timex indiglo watch. 
 based on the late 1960 's television show by the same name, the mod squad tells the tale of three reformed criminals under the employ of the police to go undercover. 
 however, things go wrong as evidence gets stolen and they are immediately under suspicion. 
 of course, the ads make it seem like so much more. 
 quick cuts, cool music, claire dane 's nice hair and cute outfits, car chases, stuff blowing up, and the like. sounds like a cool movie, 
 does it not? 
 after the first fifteen minutes, it quickly becomes apparent that it is not. 
 the mod squad is certainly a slick looking production, complete with nice hair and costumes, but that simply is n't enough. 
 the film is best described as a cross between an hour- long cop show and a music video, both stretched out into the span of an hour and a half. and 
 with it comes every single clich?

 it does n't really matter that the film is based on a television show, as most of the plot elements have been recycled from everything we 've already seen. 
 the characters and acting is nothing spectacular, sometimes even bordering on wooden. 
 claire danes and omar epps deliver their lines as if they are bored, which really transfers onto the audience. 
 the only one to escape relatively unscathed is giovanni ribisi, who plays the resident crazy man, ultimately being the only thing worth watching. 
 unfortunately, even he 's not enough to save this convoluted mess, as 
 all the characters do n't do much apart from occupying screen time. 
 with the young cast, cool clothes, nice hair, and hip soundtrack, it appears that the film is geared towards the teenage mindset.

"sydney lumet is the director whose work happens to be of varied quality. 
 he is praised for some of the most important films of the previous decades, like twelve angry men, serpico or the verdict. 
 but, in the same time, almost any of such pearls is followed by stinkers 
 that hamper lumet 's reputation. 
 a stranger among us, 1992 rip- off of peter weir 's witness, belongs to the latter category. 
 the heroine of this movie is emily eden( melanie griffith), tough lady cop who sometimes shows too much enthusiasm in battling bad guys on the streets of new york. 
 during one of such actions, her partner nick( jamey sheridan) got hurt and as a result, she becomes depressed. 
 in order to help her recover, bosses give her rather easy task of locating missing jeweller who belonged to hassidic jew community. 
 emily starts investigation and soon realises that the case involves murder. 
 concluding that the perpetrator belongs to community, she decides to go undercover. 
 that is n't easy, because her modern manners are colliding with traditionalist ways. 
 things get even more complicated when she develops feelings for young cabalistic scholar ariel( eric thal). using peter weir 's formula is n't the greatest flaw of this film. 
 even the lame and unispiring crime mystery subplot works to the certain extent. 
 but the worst insult 
 to viewer 's audience is terrible miscasting of melanie griffith. 
 the author of this review never liked this actress very much, but she was at least tolerable in some of her roles. 
 role of emily eden, unfortunately, is n't one of them. 
 first of all, she ca n't pass for tough nypd street fighter, and her attempt to pass for orthodox jewish woman is n't much better.

"is evil dead ii a bad movie? 
 it 's full of terrible acting, pointless violence, and plot holes 
 yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release. 
 explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots( including the original evil dead) is extremely difficult. 
` well what 's it about?' 
` five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly, hairy, wart covered monsters.' 
` come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week. 
 why should i see it again?' 
` no evil dead ii is different, it 's funny.' 
` it 's funny to see people die? 
 are you sick or something?' 
 maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie. 
 his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle, as disturbing as it is hilarious. 
 an example of raimi 's odd approach: a monster( formerly protagonist ash 's girlfriend of all people) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound. 
 sure it 's over- the- top, but it is so over- the- top that it is laugh out loud funny; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood, staining his face and knocking him back a few feet. 
 the whole movie is like this, watch ash get beat up, watch ash defeat the monster, watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster. 
 the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets, the more amusing it becomes. 
 no matter how sick it may sound, it is funny to watch 
 bruce ampbell 's ash get his butt kicked every five minutes. 
 and raimi takes advantage, he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend, by the body of an old lady, even by his own right hand.",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film's humor, unique execution, and the director's work.

"it 's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year, but that is what disney and pixar animation; s latest film represents. 
 while a bugs life is n't nearly as deep as it 's predecessor, dreamwork 's antz, 
 it is just as funny. 
 a bug 's life centers, appropriately, around the life of an ant, named flik. 
 flik, cutely voiced by newsradio 's david foley, hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task. 
 when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost, the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way. 
 the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them. 
 the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey. 
 when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food. 
 when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission, they never dream he will be successful, they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food. 
 flik 's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return. 
 instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors. 
 when he returns with the` warriors', the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes. 
 a bug 's life has animation that is simply stunning.

 pseudo- substance- hollywood faking deep meanings in their films. 
 have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed, then when you look back, you realize there was something missing?

 i 'm not trying to say city of angels is that bad. 
 it had a lot going for it, but somewhere along the way, it faltered. 
 somehow, underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all, there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography. 
 the predictable ending that shattered our hopes( even though we saw it coming) only added to the disappointment.

 nicolas cage is seth, a guardian angel who, like hundreds( likely thousands or even millions) of other angels, spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life. 
 meg ryan, in her most subdued performance yet, plays maggie, a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is we 're fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive.

 angels, who we quickly learn are not and never were humans, can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch, but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire.

"the makers of spawn have created something almost as vacuous 
 as this summer 's other comic book adaptation, batman and robin. 
 both films make the mistake of adapting for the screen not only the look of their graphic counterparts, but also their monosyllabic dialogue and empty- headed character motivations. 
 in panel- sized morsels, implausible plots and"" rambo

 spawn is ostensibly about an assassin named simmons( white) who is framed by a corporate baddie( played without irony by sheen), then set on fire and left for dead. 
 though the movie skimps on the next few plot points, here 's what i could determine: said assassin then becomes the leader of satan 's army, under the tutelage of a flatulating midget named clown( leguizamo, grating as always). 
 he is renamed, for reasons unbeknownst, spawn, and granted a really cool costume that enables him to become something of a human chameleon. 
 but when spawn spies on a birthday party for his child, he realizes that he ca n't be the evil superdemon he 's expected to be, and he sets about avenging his untimely death.

 the central premise behind the film is an inspired and promising one. 
 bobby bowfinger( martin), a cheapskate and small- time hollywood producer, has always dreamed of making a successful motion picture but has never attained the proper tools to do so.

 the other veterans who return( dennis haysbert as voodoo- inspired batter cerrano and takaaki ishibashi as tanaka, who was introduced in"" league ii"") seem to be around just to lend legitimacy to the enterprise.

 first this is the film to bring back the shaw brothers studio back to the forefront of film production. 
 secondly, the film is the re- discovery of yuen biao.

 poverty and crime rule most of china. 
 a young man, ma wing jing and his brother enter the fabled city and become laborers at the pier.

"as you should know, this summer has been less than memorable. 
 with a total of 4 decent films, it 's not a surprise that these big budget failures keep appearing. 
 with that said, you can pretty much predict what my opinion on"" the 13th warrior"" will be. 
 the film is based on the michael crichton"" eaters of the dead"", in which ahmed ibn fahdlan is banished from his country for looking at a wife of a king. 
 after tarveling for many months, he comes across a gang of norsemen, who are forced to pick 13 men to protect a town from mythical monsters who travel in the fog. 
 so, they start picking men, and are left without 1, thus ahmed is choosen. 
 so far it sounds interesting right? 
 not when all of this takes place in 15 minutes. 
 after that, they basically run around killing. 
 that alone shows how much a script is needed for a film, because once your story is introduced, you have the rest of the film to start developing it. 
 obviously that 's not the case here. 
 even if you are going into the film expecting an action packed adventure, you will be disappointed. 
 since all the action takes place in fog, 
 it is constantly hard to see a scene clearly due to those circumstances, and to poor camera work.

 i 'd like to actually watch a film in focus, but again, they failed to deliver that as well. 
 the film moves on and on until the point, where you can care less about anything but the popcorn you 're eating. 
 with corny dialogue, that the characters laugh at for some odd reason, a script that goes nowhere, dull action sequences, a predictable ending, and worst of all weak characters, there 's basically nothing to like here, except for maybe the set designs.

"jackie chan kicks his way into van damme territory with twin dragons, an embarrassingly bland action comedy of mistaken identities. 
 chan plays separated- at- births boomer and john ma, whose drastically different paths... 
 aw, forget the plot description, it 's not even worth the space. 
 but let 's face it. 
 no one goes to jackie chan movies for the plot anyway. 
 the scenes where nothing happens in chan 's films have always been little more than glue thriftily spread to hold the action sequences together. 
 in the case of twin dragons, however, the tiresome plot- driving scenes fritter away so much of the movie that you almost want to shout( at the risk of demeaning the artistic value of cinema),"" get to the good part already!"" most of the film is devoted to showing the brothers' efforts to hide the other 's existence from their own acquaintances. 
 why it is necessary to do this is not satisfactorily explained, but neither are a lot of aspects of the plot. 
 the twins' love interests, demure club- singer barbara( chan- film regular maggie cheung) and lusty bride- hopeful tammy( nina li chi), get disoriented in all the brouhaha, yet strangely seem not to mind that they are not sure which brother they are in love with. 
 the scenes describing the boys' bumbling antics get stretched so thin 
 we stop caring who chan is supposed to be in any given shot( in several shots, in fact, even the make- up and hair people seem to forget which brother is which.). 
 even chan 's so- corny- it's- funny humor is off- kilter in this outing. 
 some of the gags are so carefully innocuous they 're annoying. 
 a case in point: whenever anyone sees the brothers together, they fall to the ground in a dead faint. 
 are we laughing yet? 
 as usual, the final showdown is the film 's jewel, a tour de force display of chan' s agility and grace",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer found the movie to be bland and the plot tiresome.

"you 've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi, but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over` keeping the faith'. 
 it 's a fluffy comedy, thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer, regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head- on. 
 as youngsters, brian finn, jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio. 
 while their friendship progressed, anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support, so neither would feel excluded. but tragedy soon struck, as anna was forced to move away. 
 now adults, brian( edward norton) and jacob( ben stiller) hold similar but contrastive jobs. 
 the likable and kind- hearted father brian is a catholic priest, while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi. 
 on the basketball court, they refer to themselves as` the god squad'. 
 in the relationship field, brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy, but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory. 
 everything changes when anna( jenna elfman) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums. 
 now a workaholic, she devotes endless hours per week to her business, but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob- both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again. 
 with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail, there 's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters. 
 predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult, but` keeping the faith' is open, entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a

 his girlfriend, mary( catherine keener) has no pretensions about her career: she 's a makeup artist, working for the eccentric fashion photographer blair( marlo thomas) and supermodel of the month, sahara( bridgette wilson). 
 sahara, who has acquired a new age spirituality from repeated viewing of the little mermaid, has an on- again, off- again relationship with joe 's best friend, bob( maxwell caulfield). 
 however, bob has gotten his biggest break yet: a starring role on a soap opera opposite the beautiful kelly( daryl hannah), who may be that illusive woman he 's always pursued: a real blonde. 
 there are some moments of good humor in the real blonde, but not enough.

"susan granger 's review of"" big eden""( jour de fete) 
 it 's utopia, this tiny town tucked away in the timberland of northwestern montana, where old codgers lounge on the porch of the general store to pass the time away and the local matchmakers( nan martin, louise fletcher) eagerly pair off the young people, regardless of sexual preference. 
 there 's nary a homophobe or bigot around, much to the surprise of henry hart( arye gross), a successful but lonely manhattan artist who returns home to care for sam( george coe), the ailing grandfather who raised him. 
 and with the simultaneous re- appearance of his best- friend from high- school and object of his unrequited love( tim dekay), now divorced with two young sons, the fact of his homosexuality must be faced. 
 to complete the triangle, there 's 
 the tall, taciturn native american( eric schweig) who owns the general store and lovingly yet secretly prepares gourmet meals for henry and sam. 
 this fable about home and family is a major debut for first- time film- maker thomas bezucha( a former designer for coach and polo/ ralph lauren) who is meticulous about minding details, using ballads like"" welcome to my world"" and"" achin', breakin' heart"" to set up the concept of our universal longing to find a place in which we can love and be loved. 
 in the paradise of big eden, what you are does n't matter as much as generosity of spirit, respect and kindness. 
 sure, the plot 's implausible but it 's a good- natured fantasy 
 so allowances should be made. 
 and rob sweeney 's photography of glacier national park is spectacular!

 only the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash. 
 the ending, as it turns out, is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film 's finer moments.

"staring, george clooney, arnold schwarzenegger, chris o'donnell and uma thurman with alicia silverstone. 
 well to start this off 
 i 'd just like to say a couple things. 
 first is, i miss michael keaton, i miss tim burton and would much prefer to think that these last two batman films are all like a dallas dream sequence. 
 not even from the first film was batman really the' star' though he was damn close in the first couple anyway. 
 in' batman forever' and now in' batman& robin' 
 he 's almost pushed to being a bit player. 
 i ca n't really say if clooney( who regardless was better than kilmer) was a very good batman or not. 
 he 's given next to nothing to do at all, he might as well not have been there and it would n't have made much difference. 
 now, joel schumacher has said that he refuses to bend to the masses that have hated his films and cheered for the return of buton that he wo nt make batman brooding and dark. 
 fine, i mean granted' batman returns' while being an awsome film was a bit to dark sometimes. 
 yet his bright neon, campy style is just killing anything this series meant to me. 
 i 'm usually very easy on films. 
 i loved' con air' and other films some critics have slammed. 
 granted that film really was paper thin 
, cliche ridden, except for one thing, it was fun. 
 there is virtually no fun in this film at all. 
 i could n't have cared less. 
 it 'll thrill the little ones as there s no violence really, none everyone comes out fine in the end like those old tv shows where it ends with everyone laughing.

"ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances. 
 for his followup to the academy- beloved the english patient, he has once again turned to a love story, this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong( little women). 
 despite some obvious overplotting, oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences. 
 the film opens in the mid-1800s, with parallel storylines in new south wales, australia and devon, england. 
 as the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us, lucinda leplastrier( cate blanchett) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback. 
 meanwhile, half the world away, oscar hopkins( fiennes) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues, and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest. 
 lucinda is fascinated with glass; oscar is obsessed with theology. 
 lucinda is rich; oscar is poor. 
 lucinda is forward and self- assured; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself. 
 yet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble, whether it 's on horses, dogs, cards, or the flip of a coin. 
 and fate has decreed that they will one day meet. 
 that day does n't occur until 45 minutes into the film, when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney, australia, where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help. 
 another of the passengers is lucinda, who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly- acquired glassworks factory. 
 at first, their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor, but it does n't take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other. 
 a friendship is born, and, once they reach australia, it develops into something more potent. 
 but oscar is uncertain of lucinda 's affection, and feels he must do something",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the performances of the actors, the direction, and the storyline.

"it 's ironic that the best films in cinema history are invariably the original director 's cut of the film. 
 films such as aliens, the abyss, the wild bunch, blade runner, and terminator 2 are all prime examples of a filmmaker 's integrity, later chopped up or mucked with by the studio. 
 the advent of the dvd format has provided a more accessible way to get these original cuts to the public and provide to film freaks like myself the ability to become further enraptured by the extension of such classic films. 
 the dvd release of the original international version of luc besson 's 1995 masterpiece the professional, which is known as l? on around the world, is a prime example of how a good film can become an instant classic 
 as a director 's cut. 
 for years, i have heard of an"" international"" version available only in laserdisc format, which has eluded me for years. 
 i even bought a laserdisc player from my uncle don for 100 bucks just to watch certain directors' cuts- including l? on. 
 but after countless searches in laserdisc stores, i could never find it. until now. 
 the film follows the story of l? 
 on, played by jean reno, a professional hit man for an italian mob crew run by danny aiello. 
 he lives next door to a ferociously independent 12-year- old girl named mathilda- played by then newcomer natalie portman, whose father is involved in drugs and crooked cops. 
 one day, a crew of the cops- lead by gary oldman in an over- the- top performance- kills her entire family while mathilda is out buying groceries.

"this is the best british gangster film since the long good friday. 
 jon bennet( played by andrew howard) is an extremely good assassin. 
 as such he is probably an evil man but it does not worry him. 
 he has become an unquestioning weapon. 
 he is in the employ of a kingpin( david calder) far more evil than he is. 
 but even assassins have innocent pasts. 
 he runs into an old from school days and he is married to a mutual girl friend from school. 
 complicating matters is that they live near where he had a recent job and their young daughter may have seen him at the crime.

 he is at once seductive and repellent like a beautiful venomous snake. 
 his lair is underground, apparently in a sewer, where he lives like the king of sewer rats. 
 it is the kingpin who pulls the strings that will control bennet 's life. 
 paul 
 sarossy who directs spent most of his career as a cinematographer and like the kingpin 's lair, he has molded images of class and style out of the darkness. by using semi- darkness and letting the colors of deep blue and black dominate every scene he makes the film visually as ominous as anything in this nether world. 
 this is a world that is cold and unfriendly. 
 sorossy creates a world of violence much more by what we hear than what we see. 
 this is a film with a great deal of physical violence occurring just out of reach. 
 we see very little but we hear a great deal more and we imagine more than that.

 one of the bad guys was a surprise. 
 the pace is fast enough, there are some"" action"" scenes. 
 i think that this is a reasonable family summer movie for families with older kids who have already seen maverick.

 little( hugh laurie and geena davis) visit the orphange, they decide to adopt stuart, a talking mouse( voiced by michael j. fox). 
 george is n't so fond of his new brother when stuart arrives at the little house, and neither is snowbell the family cat( voiced by nathan lane). 
 george and stuart eventually bond while preparing for a remote control boat race, but snowbell wants stuart out of the house( he 's unable to live with the taunts of other neighborhood felines saying it 's ridiculous that a mouse has a pet cat). 
 stuart little is a mix of live action and computer generated imagery( cgi). 
 the character of stuart, while obviously a computer generated image, grows on you as the film progresses and you 'll soon see him as much more than a mere special effect

 there is also a great deal of animal training involved with this film, as many of the"" supporting cast"" are actual cats( with computer animated mouths so they can speak).

"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie. 
 action movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences, while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full- circle. 
 for fans of both genres, however, realism is key. 
 action fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic, and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie 's end. 
 on this advice, director john frankenheimer( the island of dr. 
 moreau) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller, ronin. 
 the depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing, considering the fare that 's fallen into the same category over the last few years. 
 the script, written by j. 
 d. 
 zeik in his big- screen debut 
, approaches levels of complexity 
 that had people spinning away from mission: impossible two years ago. 
 a certain number of people will be lost by this, but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times. 
 frankenheimer masters the script with poise, and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post- cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck. 
 his ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here, and ronin becomes a better movie because of it. 
 robert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time. 
 he takes command and offers much gravity as the ex- spy sam, a man who 's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre( natascha mcelhone) recover a package. 
 the package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast, especially once the requisite double- crossing begins, and its role is skillfully penned by zeik.

 that, however, is what happens when legendary screenwriter william goldman takes a pass at an otherwise brutally predictable conspiracy thriller.

 army 's criminal investigation division. 
 his latest case is the murder of captain elisabeth campbell( leslie stefanson) at a georgia base, the victim found tied to the ground after an apparent sexual assault and strangulation. 
 complicating the case is the fact that capt. 
 campbell is the daughter of general joe campbell( james cromwell), a war hero and potential vice- presidential nominee.

 it is, in fact, surprising that carpenter managed to fit so many pieces of his previous work into this film in such an admittedly novel way. 
 but that still does not make for a really good science fiction experience. 
 ghosts of mars takes place in the year 2176. 
 mars has been mostly terraformed so that humans can walk on the surface without breathing gear( which is good for the film 's budget). 
 it is never mentioned, but the gravity on mars has been increased somehow to earth- normal, again making it easier to film. 
 society has changed a bit by that time, but it has advanced surprisingly little. 
 apparently the culture has changed so that women are much more in positions of control. 
 and from carpenter 's view, women have really made a mess of things. 
 society has stagnated under female control so that beyond some minor technological advances society has changed less in 175 years than we might expect it to change in ten. 
 the basic plot of ghosts of mars has much in",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the film's lack of horror scenes, the reprise of many ideas from the director's previous films, and the stagnation of society under female control.

 no, this is n't the lineup for monday night football. 
 rather, these are the two opposing forces that will battle to the death in"" the 13th warrior,"" a film that is as dramatically flat as it is gratuitously gory. 
 based on michael crichton 's book, eaters of the dead, this viking saga tries to evoke the mysticism of fabled norsemen and the glorious battles that they fought. 
 their strength and honor would eventually etch their place in history among the greatest warriors that ever picked up a sword. 
 luckily for the vikings, however, their warring abilities were not as clumsy as this film. 
 antonio bandaras is ahmed, a travelling ambassador. 
 accompanied by his friend( omar shariff in a cameo), they eventually come across a small viking village. 
 we see that the vikings are an extremely proud group whose greatest strength is their fortitude.

 but their festivities are about to be halted when a messenger boy arrives to tell the village leader that a great evil is threatening their land.

 every journey a fishing boat makes can be an all- or- nothing risk. 
 it is life at its most exhilarating and its most terrifying,"" says director wolfgang petersen("" das boot""). 
 and that 's just what he captures in this true story of struggle and humanity aboard a swordfishing boat, the andrea gail, sailing out of gloucester, massachusetts, in late october, 1991. 
 early in bill wittliff 's screenplay, based on sebastian junger 's best- seller, we meet the crew of six. 
 the veteran captain( george clooney) is frustrated because he ca n't find fish on the grand banks, yet a rival skipper( mary elizabeth mastrantonio) brings in huge hauls. 
 his right- hand man( mark walhberg) needs money to build a new life with his girl- friend( diane lane). 
 there 's a devoted dad( john c. reilly) with an estranged wife and son, a free- spirited jamaican( allen payne), a lonely guy( john hawkes), and a last- minute replacement with a bad attitude( william fichtner). 
 the skipper 's convinced he can change his bad luck streak in remote flemish cap, and he does. 
 but then trouble begins. 
 there 's a rogue wave, a man overboard and the ice machine breaks- with 60, 000 lb. of fish that could spoil.

" there will be another,"" the ads for this sequel proclaimed, and why not? true, brandon lee is dead, but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 's the crow, anyway. 
 the idea of spinning artist james o'barr 's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie, taking its own righteous vengeance against the world. 
 given that basic framework, the story could move in any number of directions. 
 of course, it does n't. 
 stubbornly, the crow: city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film, when lee 's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death. 
 i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality. 
 in flashback, we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover, and then we watch in real- time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind. 
 it 's loud and repetitive, true, a sadist 's delight -- but it 's also horrifying and fascinating. 
 city of angels gives us more of the same, but less skillfully. 
 there 's an audience guaranteed for a film like this, although bad reviews and poor word- of- mouth will likely ensure that it wo n't be much of a success. 
 in fact, miramax subsidiary dimension films was so fearful of the critical reaction to this picture that reviewers were shut out of advance screenings.

"in tim burton 's` sleepy hollow', there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name. 
 he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe. 
 burton 's update on washington irving 's classic tale of` the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman, when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror. 
 writer andrew kevin walker(` seven')

 as` sleepy hollow' opens, we 're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau, who won an oscar in burton 's` ed wood'. 
 landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow, who, on a fateful carriage ride through the forest, is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider. 
 after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town, constable ichabod crane( johnny depp) is sent in to investigate. 
 landlord baltus von tassel( michael gambon) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case, and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods. 
 crane is not a man of great superstition, and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie).

 this premise -- kafka by way of cronenberg -- is the background for the hole, which could have been a great movie, but, sadly, ends up as a waste of good ideas.

 like its own opening shot, from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity, persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent. 
 a sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry, boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking. 
 the film follows a soft- spoken young man, eddie adams( mark wahlberg) from torrance, through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom, and later, to a harrowingly precipitous drop. 
 as boogie nights opens, he 's toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub, and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity. 
 recruited by fatherly jack horner( a rejuvenated burt reynolds), a successful porn filmmaker, eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler, pornstar. 
 wholeheartedly embraced by jack 's troupe, including the maternal amber waves( julianne moore), reed rothchild( john c. reilly), buck swope( don cheadle), rollergirl( heather graham), dirk and his"" one special thing"" are quickly propelled to the top of his field, fulfilling his mantra of being a"" big bright shining star"". 
 his lack of discipline, however, incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in.

 well when it comes to this movie being as horrible as it is, williams ca n't take all the blame, but he sure ca n't justify himself with his own simple tag line either. 
 fred has dreamed of space travel since he was a young boy, turning the clothes dryer into a mock space shuttle and staring out wide- eyed at a poster of the earth. 
 as a 30-year- old, fred has n't grown up much, but at least he 's somewhat closer to his goal, now designing astronaut software for nasa.

 well, it 's hard to tell after watching the movie as well. 
 bruce willis is a resident of the future, and it is a rather bleak future. 
 the world 's population had disintigrated into a mere 200, 000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals. 
 the reason? in 1995, an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus, thus wiping out practically the world 's population in a mere month. 
 bruce willis' character is one of the surviving few, but is enslaved by scientists, as are most of last living humans. 
 they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task: go into the past, find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys, and kill him.

 star wars episode i: 
 the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world( i was more into star trek: the next generation), it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment, the phantom menace. 
 however, it ca n't be ignored. 
 endless toys lining the shelves, endless news reports, and a multi- billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult. 
 with the level of this hype, one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998, godzilla, which definitely failed to live up to expectations. 
 thankfully, the phantom menace does much, much better. 
 while the"" first"" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker, the prequels backpedal to tell the back- story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader). 
 without blowing too much of the story, the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo, which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation, and it 's up to two jedi knights( qui- gon ji, played by liam neeson and obi- wan kenobi, played by ewan mcgreggor) to free it. 
 the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics, leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat. 
 common complaints range from lack of characterization, weak narrative, poor direction of actors, the dated style, and too much focus over special effects.

 fahdlan is chosen as the 13th and last warrior in a moment that is so desperately overacted and overdone that numerous persons at the screening i attended broke out into laughter. 
 the movie proves to be a new low point for banderas, who 's acting seems closer to that of his role as the lover and caretaker for a dying gay man in 1993 's philadelphia, than that of a warrior.

 is n't there a law or something? 
 this diabolical load of claptrap from steven speilberg 's dreamworks studio is hollywood family fare at its deadly worst. 
 mouse hunt takes the bare threads of a plot and tries to prop it up with overacting and flat- out stupid slapstick that makes comedies like jingle all the way look decent by comparison. 
 writer adam rifkin and director gore verbinski are the names chiefly responsible for this swill.

 but battling them at every turn is a very smart mouse, happy with his run- down little abode and wanting it to stay that way. 
 the story alternates between unfunny scenes of the brothers bickering over what to do with their inheritance and endless action sequences as the two take on their increasingly determined furry foe. 
 whatever promise the film starts with soon deteriorates into boring dialogue, terrible overacting, and increasingly uninspired slapstick that becomes all sound and fury, signifying nothing. 
 the script becomes so unspeakably bad that the best line poor lee evens can utter after another run in with the rodent is: 
"" i hate that mouse"".

 yet it 's almost as good. 
 it 's simple, yet strangely complex, and astonishingly rewarding, because instead of moving from plot point to plot point, and merely laying out they- might- be- caught overtones, it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to, all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral. 
 elegantly directed by sam raimi( yes, the same),"" a simple plan"" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright, moderately financially stable working man( bill paxton), his dim- witted brother( billy bob thornton), and his drinking buddy( brent briscoe). without anyone around, and the possibility that no one would come looking for it, the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes, they will keep it, but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking, and so they generally do n't flaunt anything they do n't want to flaunt, they 'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton.

"one- sided"" doom and gloom"" documentary about the possible annihilation of the human race as foretold by the bible. 
 orson welles narrates and appears in the film in which he, along with best- selling author hal lindsey, discusses various prophecies from the bible and relates them to recent( well for 1976 anyway) events. 
 the film is dated badly, as many things that are supposed to happen in the"" future"" never do. 
 for example, the planets of the solar system were supposed to line up in the year 1982 and 
 cause chaos here on earth. 
 we 're still here. 
 the arms race between the soviets and america was supposed to kick- off the apocalypse. 
 we 're still here. 
 some of the more ludicrous moments come when it 's alluded to that people like jimmy carter and henry kissinger may actually be the antichrist(!). 
 also, there 's ten minutes of stock footage at the end of the film meant to give us an idea of what the battle for armageddon might be like. 
 if it 's anything like it 's depicted as here 
 then it 's going to be incredibly boring. 
 the late great planet earth is available on dvd from vci home video. 
 it contains the film in standard form( aspect ratio of 1. 33: 1), although some moments of stock footage are letterboxed. 
 also included are brief bios on orson welles and hal lindsey, as well as a trailer for another recent vci home video release, chariots of the gods. 
 audio is mono dolby digital, and the video is fair to good for a film like this. 
 i believe this is the first appearance of this film on any home video format so any condition at all is fine with me.

 curiously, the menu screens on this dvd look nothing like the menu screens pictured on the back of the case.

 sweetheart and football hero dick dickson( michael dotson). 
 when april gets extreme cold feet she runs home, sticks a gun in her mouth, and pulls the trigger.

"a miracle of filmmaking,"" some like it hot"" is a brilliant film, and maybe the foremost example of slapstick comedy brought to screen with clever sight gags and plot twists. 
 it is the pinnacle of writer- director billy wilder 's career, a stunning feat considering the vast catalogue of films he had helped make. 
 jerry( lemmon) and joe( curtis) are two stage musicians who go from gig to gig, trying to earn enough money to feed themselves. 
 one night, as they 're playing at a banned prohibition speakeasy, the place is raided. as it turns out, the owner, spats columbo( george raft) was ratted out by toothpick charlie( george e. stone). 
 several weeks later, on valentine 's day, jerry and joe go to a garage to pick up a car and end up witnessing a gangland murder of charlie by columbo in a parking garage. 
 eager to escape, the duo are forced to take a job in florida with all expenses paid. 
 the only catch.. 
 its a girls band. 
 so josephine( curtis) and daphne( lemmon) 
, make their way onto the train and go to florida. 
 on the way there, they meet sugar kane( monroe), a bombshell singer who is looking for love. 
 jerry and joe immediately fall for the singer, but there 's two problems: 1) they 're in drag, and 2) millionaire osgood fielding( joe e. brown) 
 falls madly in love with daphne.

 tony curtis is hysterical as joe/ josephine, especially in his preposterous attempts to woo sugar.

"wild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon, denise richards, and neve campbell that deals with all the issues; sex, love, murder, and betrayal. 
 the setting of the film is a town named blue bay. 
 it consists of many swamps and slums and, on the other hand, rich estates owned by the town 's different benefactors. 
 the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the town 's ritzy, expensive high school. 
 it is here that we meet all of the core characters. 
 there 's guidance counselor sam lombardo, police officers ray duquette and gloria perez, dark mysterious senior suzie toller, and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan. 
 we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor, but none more than kelly. 
 throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape. 
 shortly after, suzie, too, confesses that sam raped her as well. 
 this pushes kelly 's sex craving mother, sandra, to stop at nothing until sam is convicted. 
 during the trial, kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her. 
 however, it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls, it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor. 
 after sam is cleared, kelly 's mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her. 
 it is then revealed that sam, kelly, and suzie were all in on it together. 
 it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda. 
 matt dillon stars as sam lombardo.

"a month ago i wrote that speed 2 was the worst film i 've ever reviewed on paper. 
 i did n't know at the time 
 that i 'd soon encounter and despise batman& robin, which has just overtaken speed 2 as the picture least worthy of your attention this summer. as directed by joel schumacher( who now specializes in batman sequels and john grisham adaptations and is n't very good at either), b& r is 
 one long excuse for a taco bell promotion. 
 the plot, which has mr. freeze and poison ivy( uma thurman) planning to take over gotham city and then"" the vorld""( as an oddly ineffective schwarzenegger states), is weighted down by repetitive asides about the nature of trust, partnership, 
 blah, blah, blah. 
 but morals are not the point of this film -- topping each bloated, confusing action scene 
 with next one is.

"if you have n't plunked down your hard- earned money yet for"" wild wild west,"" the latest summer holiday offering from will smith, let me say right now that your money will be better spent on a starbuck 's frappacino or on a ben& jerry 's sundae. 
 these treats are great relief from the summer heat. 
 in contrast, this film made me simmer in disappointment. 
 i can accept the fact that summer movies tend to put more weight into special effects and that good stories and flavorful characters usually take a back seat. 
 this was true of star wars episode i, but at least in that film, the story and the characters were still in the back seat. 
 in this film, they are no where to be found. 
 what remains are hundreds of male extras costumed as gunslingers and foppish aristocrats, lots of female extras who look like can- can dancers, and a clunky, 80-foot tall instrument of destruction that resembles a mechanical tarantula. 
 two men are asked to stop this threat. 
 one is artemus gordon( kevin kline), an inventor who uses his intellect and array of disguises to best his opponents. 
 among his creations are false breasts and the bulletproof vest. 
 the other man is jim west( will smith), who prefers the shoot- first- then- shoot- some- more method of investigating. 
 although their individual talents must be combined to achieve success, their interaction with one another merely seemed like a second rate, two- man vaudevillian act. 
 for example, there is a scene where west, being more debonair than the reserved gordon, notes that the fake breasts should be filled with water rather than buckwheat, which is what it is currently filled with. 
"" now touch my breast,"" west says. 
 gordon does so and then softly coos his approval. 
 i found myself groaning at this kind of silliness. 
 the script fails to generate any sense of drama, humor, or fun for that matter. 
 i did enjoy kline 's reserved performance",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer was disappointed with the movie ""Wild Wild West"". The reviewer felt that the movie lacked a good story and interesting characters, and was not impressed with the humor or the script.

"as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment, hollywood does n't loose the oppertunity to get involved, by telling stories and expressing opinions. 
 this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels, hays hodges( tommy lee jones) and terry childers( samuel l. jackson). 
 they fought side by side in vietnam, where childers saved hodges' life by shooting an unarmed pow. 
 that 's against the rules of war but understandable, in this story anyway, under the specific circumstances. 
 certainly hodges is not complaining. 
 years pass. 
 hodges, whose wounds make him unfit for action, gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer. 
 childers, is now a respected and much- decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould. 
 because of his excellent record, childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador( ben kingsley), cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops. 
 childers does what he has to do: evacuate the family and protect the men under his command. 
 after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire, he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd. 
 more than 80 yemeni men, women, and children are mowed down. 
 childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians. 
 he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film. 
 did childers violate authorized u. s. 
 military rules of engagement? 
 or are there simply no rules in war?

"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship, a green ovular pin, and the birth of oscar wilde, but if one really strains, they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off. 
 wilde 's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature, and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned, loosing his family and his career. 
 the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise. 
 the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality), they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else. 
 and that 's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began. 
 it 's been said that todd haynes'"" velvet goldmine,"" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement, not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it, steals a lot from"" citizen kane,"" and that 's true. 
 in the film, a british journalist in the 80s, arthur stuart( christian bale), is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade, a fictitious rock star, who faked his own death on stage, bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement. 
 structure- wise

 this is no"" kane,"" and it really does n't aspire to be: it",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciated the film's unique beginning and its exploration of the glam rock movement.

"at times, you 'd think edtv would be an entertaining film. 
 i mean, who can resist the story of your average joe becomming a celebrity by having his life filmed every minute of every day? 
 but this average joe, ed perkuny,( matthew mcconaughay), is a sappy, lifeless creation that wanders around, trying to solve everyone 's problems and settle his own. 
 mcconaughay is awful, especially because he is trying to pull off his usual hollywood charm with a 3 week beard and torn jeans. 
 frankly, he had more charm in the devestating flop 
 the newton boys. 
 he overacts in every way: his overexaggerant body language, obsession with kissing women every second 
 he gets the chance, and that cliched scene where he loses someone in his life, and drops to his knee and cries.

"synopsis: private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband. 
 after uncovering the authenticity of the film, welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers. 
 comments: 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time. 
 though it does n't present a snuff film( a movie which documents a person 's murder for real, usually during or after some form of sexual act) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as, say, natural born killers, 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it. 
 it is not fun to watch; see something else if you get upset by realistic, sadistic violence. 
 this film 's violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory. 
 for those with strong stomachs, however, 8 mm is an intelligent, worthwhile thriller, especially during its second hour. 
 nicolas cage, after a couple ho- hum movies, returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities. 
 as tom welles, a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly- born daughter, cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants. 
 serving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix, who plays a struggling songwriter named max california. 
 california, despite his name, is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character, and phoenix 
 does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character. 
 the real star of the movie, though, must be peter stormare. 
 stormare played the"" really, really evil guy"" in fargo, and his character, dino velvet, in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable. 
 his performance is very chilling. 
 8 mm 's success may hardly be surprising.

 someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer, but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals? 
 adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film. 
 he does n't play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny.
