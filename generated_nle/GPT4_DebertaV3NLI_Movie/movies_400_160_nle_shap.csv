"what would you do if no one could see you? 
 well, if you 're a super smart bio- molecular research scientist working for the military, you 'd grope a co- worker and rough- up your neighbor from across the street. 
 that 's right. 
 of all the non- criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible, in"" hollow man"" kevin bacon 's character opts to commit sex crimes. 
 er, it 's kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio- molecular research scientist? 
 something sounds horribly wrong already. 
 but this is a paul verhoeven film, and the sleazepin director of such open- crotch classics as"" basic instinct"" and the infamous"" showgirls"" never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which, when you come right down to it, is all this film is about. 
"" 
 hollow man"" features a string of hapless, c- list actors 
( among them bacon, elisabeth shue, josh brolin, and kim dickens) in a grade- z plot with a lot of special effects that, frankly, do n't look much better than those used in the 1933 version of"" the invisible man. 
"" 
 oh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he 's attempting reentry but 
 otherwise it 's lots of"" thermal"" shots and inanimate objects 
( elisabeth shue included) bobbing around without any visible signs of support. 
 since invisibility, once achieved, is n't much of an effect( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other -- it amounts to much of a muchness), the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely- buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon 's character gets invisible he can head straight for them. 
 it 's as if that fascinating concept -- what would you do if no one could see you? 
 --is 
 simply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin.

"synopsis: sonny koufax( adam sandler) 
 is a rich, childish, angry man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend vanessa( kristy swanson). 
 in a bid to impress vanessa sonny impersonates his friend kevin( jon stewart) and adopts a 5 year old boy named julian( cole and dylan sprouse) while kevin is on an overseas trip. 
 under sonny 's supervision julian soon learns to lie to women, tell people how he"" wipes his ass,"" throw tantrums, and scream for his"" god damned"" treats. 
 self centered, julian breaks a school classmate 's arm without apologizing or even realizing he has done anything wrong. 
 meanwhile sonny bribes julian with sugary talk, food, toys, and flashy promises in order to get the kid to perform. 
 not surprisingly the government takes julian away from sonny 's incompetent supervision, and this leads to a custody battle. 
 opinion: it 's a movie about an embittered creep teaching a little kid to be a jerk, and we all get cheap laughs 
 because for 90 minutes the innocent kindergartner never finds out what it means when he mimics all the bad boy behavior. 
 that 's the essence of big daddy. 
 but there 's a bigger issue 
 involved: 
 marketing. 
 movies that are rated pg and pg-13 are heavily marketed towards children of preteen age and below. 
 on tv, film clips advertise these movies as family- friendly hit comedies. 
 then when you go see them they turn out to be either raunchy sex acts like austin powers with characters named fat bastard-- or big daddy where adult characters get their jollies by buddying up to naive five year olds and encouraging them to experiment with drugs and mistreatment. 
 folks in hollywood are trying to develop a preteen market for raunchy stuff, but i think most american parents would agree that early childhood is a time of mental innocence that should be protected from uncaring media market exploitation. 
 to many american mothers

"jarvis cocker of pulp once said that he wrote common people after noticing mike leigh box- sets on the video shelves -- he had a feeling that economic deprivation was becoming a tourist experience for the well- off. 
 maybe it 's a classic case of displacement: it 's easier to see jarvis' own lyrics( obsessed with acrylic and wood chip on the wall) as a fetishization of lowlife, rather than leigh 's films. 
 but it 's worth being reminded that drab interiors and a couple of working- class characters do n't make for a guarantee of' authenticity' 
, let alone a good film. 
 it 's the triumph of secrets& lies, then, that it goes beyond gestures of sympathy for the common people into a probing of just what it means to seek' authenticity' and honesty in everyday lives. 
 following her adopted mother 's funeral, hortense, a young black optometrist, sets out to find her birth mother, and is disturbed to find out that she is white. 
 it is cynthia, a factory worker who lives in a shabby house with her perpetually moody daughter roxanne. 
 cynthia 's younger brother maurice is a successful photographer who has not seen his sister for ages, largely because of his wife 's animosity towards her. 
 hortense calls up cynthia, who initially breaks down in tears and refuses to see her. 
 but their mutually suspicious meeting gives way to a warm friendship eventually. 
 cynthia invites hortense to come along to a party, which maurice is hosting...

 but if the film delivers much more than a trite message, it 's because we are also shown how hard it can be to face up to ugly truths, even while the evasions and unspoken grievances slowly choke us.

"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s. 
 for many critics, scholars and, most importantly, film producers, it was a thing of the past- something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black- and- white television and non- cgi special effects. 
 but in 1995, same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago, there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor, producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre. 
 and, same as in the case of dances with wolves, he was awarded for his effort with"" oscars"". 
 the name of the film was braveheart, and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson. 
 the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace( 1272- 1305). 
 in his time, english king edward i"" longshanks""( 
 played by patrick mcgoohan) has almost completely subdued entire british isles, including scotland, whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by"" ius primae noctis"" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights. 
 although english had killed his father many years ago, young scottish commoner william wallace( played by mel gibson) does n't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron( played by catherine maccormack). 
 murron 's death changes that and wallace takes arms and, together with small but dedicated band of followers, begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country. 
 through time, more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace 's rag- tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge. 
 but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves, especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce( played by angus macfadyen), who would n't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader.

"the tagline for this film is:"" some houses are just born bad"". 
 so i did n't expect too much from this.

 i thought: liam neeson, cathrine zeta jones and jan de bont. 
 i thought, mabe it will be fun? 
 and in fact the beginning was rather intriguing. 
 but by the end of it i thought: 
 why liam neeson and cathrine zeta jones, jan de bont?. 
 these great actors are basically helpless with this muddled mess that defies any rationality. 
 here is the story: in the monstrously over- decorated mansion known as hill house, visitors are tricked by an unknown doctor( liam neeson) into being guinea pigs in a fright experiment under the guise of an insomnia investigation. 
 among them is a sophisticated bisexual( cathrine zeta jones), a cynical dope( owen wilson) and a gentle and emotional lady( lily taylor). 
 actually, the doctor is researching the"" primordial fear reaction"" and intends to plant disturbing ideas in his subjects and watch what happens. 
 but he gets unexpected help from the house itself. 
 it rumbles, hums and belches forth remarkable sights. 
 portals become veiny stained- glass eyeballs. 
 a fireplace guarded by stone lions gapes like a sinister mouth. 
 filmy cherubic spirits take shape under sheets and billowy curtains. 
 but the computerized spooketeria rarely feels real, placing an emotional wall between audience and screen. 
 the second half of the film is basically about the main heroine running back and forth from the sinister lamps and evil furniture. 
 is that exciting or what? 
 the worst thing about it is that it did n't have to be bad. 
 it 's based on a great book,`` the haunting of hill house, '' by shirley jackson.

 it played with the greatest fears of our sub conscience.

"in the series of the erotic thrillers that flooded the videoshelves in the early 1990s came this french- canadian co- production by max fischer. 
 the movie is set in paris where its hero, struggling american author david mirkine( judd nelson, at the time specialised in playing losers and people at the edge of sanity) suffers a terrible writers bloc. 
 he manages to overcome crisis after beginning romantic relationship with beautiful model anabelle 
( laurence treill). 
 unfortunately, she hangs out in jet set circles, which gradually makes mirkine pathologically jealous. 
 her connection with powerful david caravan( pierce brosnan) would make mirkine step the line between reason and sanity and put in motion whole series of violent and tragic events.

 pacing of the film is simply too slow to thrill the viewers, and those patient enough to sit through its entirety have to wait a long time between any interesting or significant developments.

 the best moments of the film are in the opning scenes where kurt russel 's character todd is shown growing up under strict military supervision. 
 brutality through the eyes of the innocent and stripped of it every single day growing up is something that has a lot of emotional potential power behind it, and the opening scenes tap into it a little.

 inheriting the mantle from last year 's"" winner,"" matthew mcconaughey, is matt damon, and, like mcconaughey, he proves to be more than just a fresh young face, as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release -- john grisham 's the rainmaker and good will hunting. 
 damon has his first major starring role, a la mcconaughey, in a john grisham adaptation -- in this case, francis ford coppola 's take on the rainmaker. 
 damon plays wet- behind- the- ears attorney rudy baylor, who, immediately after passing the bar exam, finds himself representing the mother( mary kay place) of a terminally ill young man( john whitworth) in a big- league suit against a negligent insurance company. 
 while rudy 's( and the film 's) main concern is this case, he also finds time to protect a young wife( claire danes) from her abusive husband( melrose placer andrew shue, in a mercifully brief role). 
 written for the screen and directed by coppola, the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet 
 mostly because it does not take itself too seriously. 
 coppola 's most notable -- and effective -- contribution to the tried- and- true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself, which largely comes in the presence of danny devito( as rudy 's unlicensed co- counsel) and golden globe nominee jon voight( as the insurance company 's hotshot attorney). 
 the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous, but danes is as superb as always. 
 then, of course, there is damon, who nicely juggles the weighty( the insurance case, the spousal abuse) and the humorous( rudy 's often comical naivete) requirements of his role without missing a beat. as good as he is in the rainmaker, damon showcases the depth of his talent in good

"it was with great anticipation that i sat down to view braveheart last week as it premiered on american cable. 
 the academy award winning film had been highly acclaimed. 
 it also featured the music of one of my favorite film composers, james horner. 
 what i was in for was a disappointing and overlong film which was anything but the best picture of 1995. 
 what drags braveheart down is its screenplay. 
 it abounds with high production values: john toll 's award- winning cinematography( which also graced edward zwick 's 1994 legends of the fall), a gorgeous score by horner, and the sort of logistics that make you wish assistant directors were household names. 
 but this does not save a misguided script. 
 the film wishes to paint its central character as a hero, but the viewer 's only response to his"" heroism"" is intellectual: william wallace( producer- director mel gibson) is fighting for freedom and against tyranny, so we have to root for him. 
 but wallace 's actions paint a different story. 
 he speaks of freedom and acts of vengeance. 
 though one intellectually realizes wallace is on the right side, the film paints an unconvincing emotional portait, in which wallace is just not as bad as the english king. 
 wallace speaks of freedom, but his acts point toward vengeance. 
 after kicking the english out of scotland, he decides to invade england. 
 this is evident of a"" spartacus complex"", and this example applies both historically and cinematically. 
 the historical spartacus at one point moved from liberating slaves to sacking roman cities; the film spartacus, like braveheart, has high production values and competent performaces and is dragged down by an awful screenplay. 
 it is a shame that such an excellent score is part of such a terrible film.

 helen( weaver), after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer, darryl( harry connick jr.), has developed a phobia for being outdoors, so to speak.

 the film follows hannah( natalie ramsey) a teen looking for her mother in gatlin, nebraska, on the eve of her 21st birthday. 
 what starts out as a daughter in desperate search of her long lost mother turns into the story of hannah being the first daughter of the children of the corn, who roam the cornfields looking for adults to murder.

 really. 
 from the start the film is unclear of where its going, not developing any characters or throwing any concrete plot details across the table, constantly introducing new characters without personalities or the slightest hint of an individuality, and sub plots that have nothing to do with what seems to the main focus of the film.

 a chance meeting with a brilliant entomologist( donald pleasance) leads the two of them to team up and solve the mystery with the aid of her remarkable gift. 
 phenomena is an imaginative, original thriller.

"while watching"" shallow grave,"" i found myself periodically noticing thematic similarities to the coens'"" blood simple. 
"" 
 both are good films in which several characters, none of whom are the most conscientious to have walked the earth but still are not really evil, indulge in an act of deception that soon necessitates more serious crimes. 
 the body count rises, and before long seemingly normal people have blood on their hands. 
 both films are also flawed, but for different reasons. 
"" 
 blood simple"" is unrelentingly dark and moody, but its characterizations were a little hollow. 
"" shallow grave,"" on the other hand, is nearly flawless for an hour and twenty minutes, and then the filmmakers throw away much of what they 'd accomplished for a more standard, audience- pleasing ending. 
 the events of the film were sufficiently intense and disturbing that i honestly felt quite troubled by what i was witnessing on screen most of the time, yet there was a slight grin on my face at the end. 
 as the film begins, we are introduced to alex( ewan mcgregor), juliet( kerry fox), and david( christopher eccleston), a scottish trio living in an apartment in glasgow. 
 they are all sarcastic and occasionally obnoxious, but other than that they seem like a fairly normal bunch. 
 a man named hugo moves into the apartment 's remaining vacancy, and the next morning he is found dead of a drug overdose. 
 juliet is about to call the police when alex discovers that hugo had brought with him a suitcase filled to the brim with cash( presumably from criminal activities). 
 the three eventually decide to keep the money and cover up the death; after a drawing of straws, the particularly unenviable task of mutilating the body so as to make it unidentifiable and burying it falls to david, who had been the most reluctant to partake in the scheme from the beginning.

 milos forman 's first film since the ill- fated valmont, columbia 's the people vs. 
 larry flynt, is a vastly entertaining( if not particularly enlightening) biopic of hustler publisher and self- made millionaire larry flynt, who became an unlikely champion of freedom of speech rights in the united states in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
 the film unweaves its tale in a chronological order: we open with young and dirt- poor larry flynt and his brother jimmy, peddling jars of water in true entrepreneurial spirit out in the rural outback of kentucky. 
 cut to forward in time, where the two flynt brothers, now young men, are running the struggling hustler go- go clubs in cincinnati. 
 the strip clubs are in a dire financial state, and in a last- ditch effort to salvage the operations, flynt decides to go to a print shop and churn out a promotional newsletter. 
 this evolved into the adult periodical_ hustler_ magazine, creating larry flynt a vast financial empire, and the rest is history. 
 what sets flynt apart from other publishers is his struggles against those who would have him cease publication of his adult material, and who railed and preached against him- flynt spent time in incarceration and was paralyzed by an assassination attempt- and his driven, single- minded insistence to buck the system and fight for his freedom of expression, regardless of personal cost.

 only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies( and hospitalized as a result) does he divulge to malcolm, in a spine- tingling scene, that he sees dead people walking among us, all the time. 
 malcolm assumes, and given his profession, reasonably so, that cole is schizophrenic, not psychic, but the sincerity in cole 's anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures.

 however, even if one thinks of it as fiction,"" the prince of egypt"" remains shallow.

"stendhal 's syndrome: a condition where, in the presence of art, a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression, suicidal behaviour and personality disorder. 
 grim stuff, to be sure, but the subject of a remarkable film from italy 's master of the horror thriller dario argento. boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone 
, the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento. 
 it follows his disappointing american debut trauma( 1992), the patchy opera( 1987) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980 's. 
 based on the novel by graziella magherini, the film stars argento 's daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist- killer. 
 visiting florence to follow up several leads, she is lured by the killer alfredo( thomas kretschmann) to an art gallery, a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail. 
 at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints. 
 posing as a bystander, alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer, a strange game of cat and mouse begins. 
 a gripping story evolves, and a coherent one, too, which may surprise those familiar with argento 's often lumpy narratives. 
 the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop- hunting- killer scenario.

 the novel was a summer smash, topping best- seller lists across the country and already drawing speculation as to which popular actors of the day might play the leads. 
 the only problem: the novel was n't very good. 
 it was far more pulp than pulitzer.

"david lynch 's"" blue velvet"" begins and ends with colorful, bright shots of flowers and happy americans mowing their lawns in a seemingly perfect american town. 
 however, what lies inside this nominally safe atmosphere is a"" strange world"" of drug dealers, sadists, and murderers. 
 the opening and closing shots are a wonderful contrast to the rest of the gloomy, disturbing film. 
 they show not to make assumptions from first glance and that oddness is common in all places under all circumstances. 
 odd would be a perfect adjective to describe this film, its characters, its direction, and its story. 
 thankfully, the obscurity that"" blue velvet"" relies on is enough to make this film enjoyable. since its elements are so originally weird, you never know what will happen next. 
 this is the main goal of a movie; to be spontaneous and surprising. 
"" blue velvet"" miracuously succeeds at this even though it contains mediocre acting. 
 lynch creates such a hypnotic world that it is hard to resist his style of story telling. 
 the film starts off with the discovery of a severed ear by a college boy( kyle maclachlan). 
 from this point maclachlan finds himself involved with a lounge singer( isabella rossellinia) who has lost her son and husband to a kidnapping. 
 the plot is much more detailed than the aforementioned and this is what makes david lynch 's story telling so amazing. 
 maclachlan becomes involved in a forbidden relationship, in another relationship that could have been taken straight out of a high school flick, and he is put into the shoes of a drug dealer who has some wild adventures with some wild friends. 
 through these multiple stories, maclachlan lives multiple lives and as we follow maclachlan, we are introduced to a variety of interesting subplots. 
 lynch masterfully builds these subplots but he does not piece them all together in the very end and make a convenient crowd pleasing conclusion. 
 instead he leaves some ambiguity and forces those curious enough to get the real meaning to watch the film several several times.

"senseless 
( r) marlon wayans is a very talented physical comedian, and it is that gift that brings senseless moments of life. 
 alas, moments are simply 
 that, moments, which are not enough to lift this fantasy/ comedy above its one- joke premise. granted, that one joke is initially amusing. 
 when wayans 's darryl witherspoon, an economics major at stratford university, hits some dire financial straits, he becomes a guinea pig for a experimental drug that heightens all five senses. 
 after some initial side effects and problems controlling his superhuman senses, darryl learns to enjoy the benefits of his abilities and uses them to land a position at a highly esteemed corporate firm. 
 at this point, the film sounds more like senseful than senseless, but through some turns of the plot, darryl finds himself only able to use four of his five senses at once, essentially leaving him -- yes -- senseless. 
 this sets up some showcase moments for wayans 's gift for physical comedy, especially when darryl loses his sense of feeling and his body goes completely, hilariously limp. but these gags, and the gag behind the entire movie, 
 quickly grows stale. 
 once darryl is shown without the use of all of the senses, instead of exploring any new comic territory, director penelope spheeris and screenwriters greg erb and craig mazin 
 take the easy way out and simply recycle each form of senselessness.

 kenneth branagh 's new motion picture had to compete with all the previous frankenstein- films made throughout the years in almost every part of the world, including the most controversial version of them all- directed by james whale. 
 the dark and stormy nights, the lightning bolts, the charnel houses of spare body parts, the laboratory where victor frankenstein stirs his steaming cauldron of life are effectful. 
 but the center of the film, quieter and more thoughtful, contains the real story.

 lo and behold, following in the footsteps of campbell, hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own: the i know what you did last summer line. 
 though the original film, released last year, was watchable enough, this insipid sequel had me looking at the theater 's glowing red exit sign longingly throughout. 
 jennifer love hewitt is a very good- looking young leading lady; however, unlike neve campbell, hewitt struggles with acting. 
 she just is n't convincing in this film( and she was n't in the original either). 
 this puts many young males, including myself, in a paradoxical quandary: she 's very attractive, but the annoying, spoiled, valley girl- type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize, exploitatively, her figure.

"walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox 's anastasia. 
 but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios, the visuals are 
 the only thing fox has to brag about. 
 disney 's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and to a lesser extent, hercules. 
 with anastasia, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window. 
 some may say- so what? 
 it 's just a kid 's movie. 
 well. 
.. 
 if you have young kids, beware, as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse- rotting rasputin zombie, whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way. 
 consider yourselves warned. 
 nevertheless, the animation is quite stunning at times. 
 don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout, occasionally rivalling photographic quality. 
 and yet in other scenes, the hand- drawn material seems of the saturday- morning tv crowd, which leads me to wonder. 
.. 
 was this rushed to market to combat disney? 
 the plot, as anyone who had read history before knows, concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916. 
 not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened. 
 as for the plot --- go rent disney 's candleshoe.

"playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task: they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare 's works. 
 they also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare: i mean, really, who does n't think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate, introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter? 
 stoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare, and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare.

 shakespeare in love is one of the smartest, funniest, most touching films of the year. 
 it 's so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors

 it could have been a smug, self- important movie that panders to die- hard shakespeare fans, but the appeal of this film is almost universal: 
 if you 've ever read a play by shakespeare, or know anything about his life, it 's likely that you 'll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love. 
 joseph fiennes, brother of ralph, stars as shakespeare himself 
; he 's a delightful, irresistible lad, concerned mostly with women and detached from life 's more serious problems( debt, plague, etc.). 
 he 's commissioned to write plays for various people: queen elizabeth( judi dench) wants comedies, while local slimeball philip henslowe( geoffrey rush) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann( tom wilkinson). 
 shakespeare, however, has trouble focusing on his work.

"my giant begins with a monologue that 's more funny than not and a distinctive` princess bride,' medieval fairy- tale- in- the-? 90s feel. 
 i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was, with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy( billy crystal) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream. 
 and when sammy meets max, his giant, mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan, there is magic in the air; albeit it a bit goofy, i loved every minute of it. 
 the film, of course, plays on the size difference between the two, and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects. 
 i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max- sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons. 
 i also liked jere burns'( from tv 's` something so right') performance as the director of the film in romania. 
 at this point, the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand, particularly during his fast- paced first scene. 
 it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate, as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech. 
 however, about the time muresan becomes coherent, the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive. off the high board. 
 suddenly, we are expected to believe sammy is a do- whatever- it- takes slime ball. 
 up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure, but he did n't come off as a desperate jerk.

"ok, let 's get one thing 
 straight right away: maximum risk is no battleship potemkin( although it does have some russians in it!), but it 's not too bad, really. 
 it 's the new film from ringo lam, the latest hong kong filmmaker to defect to hollywood, and stars that minor league schwartzeneggar from belgium, jean- claude van damme( who, you will recall, also starred in john woo 's maiden hollywood effort, hard target). 
 in lam 's film, van damme plays alain moreau, a french cop( at least his accent makes more sense here than it did in hard target) who discovers that he was separated shortly after birth from a twin brother who was adopted by russians. 
 these russians defected to the united states and moved into a black neighbourhood in new york( where, i suppose, they thought they would n't be noticed).

"the second jackal- based film to come out in 1997( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal), this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland, and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo 's own alma matter, concordia university in montreal, canada. 
 the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal, but does not pretend to be 100% factual. 
 plot: naval officer ramirez( quinn) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal, in order to put an end to the actual militant 's radical activities. 
 he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee. 
 ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this"" assignment"", and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism, intrigue and double- personality syndrome( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states.) 
 critique: great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two- hour runtime. 
 admittedly, i was n't a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film, and did n't expect much from this movie beforehand, but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments, as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line. 
 the first hour is mostly just a build- up of things to come, and does offer a great characterization of the jackal, but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending. 
 quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal, but did n't offer anything extraordinary, in my opinion. 
 sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they 've played in both of their respective careers of late, but nonetheless, appeared to relish the cold- heartedness of their chosen characters.

 russell gives a fine performance, as do most of the cast, one that is not upstaged by the action orchestrated in the second half of the film.

"moviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post- salary cap era -- you 've got to know how to allocate your resources. 
 every dollar spent on a free- agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers.

 he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line. 
 watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid, fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars, is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit, except that sanders does n't have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages.

"you 've got to love disney. 
 no matter what they serve up, it is a guaranteed success as long as it 's animated.

 what 's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality. 
 you see, disney animated features these days have two components: theme and plot. 
 the theme changes with each new movie; the plot does not. 
 the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped, and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features, they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same. 
 however, while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box- office receipts, merchandising dollars, and glimmers in the eyes of little children, critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer. 
 luckily, disney 's latest animated offering, mulan, manages to be engaging and refreshing, even while rife with formula. 
 the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns, led by the imposing shan- yu( miguel ferrer). 
 soon, china 's emperor( pat morita) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china 's defense.

"originally launched in 1978, this popular film was re- introduced in 1998 to a whole new generation of moviegoers. 
 based on the mighty successful musical from broadway, grease was followed in 1980 with the less stellar grease 2( 6. 5/10), starring a young michelle pheiffer in one of her first feature film roles. 
 plot: high- school musical set in the 1950 's showcasing the relationship between the cool danny zuko of the t- birds( travolta) and the innocent and pure sandy olsen( newton- john) from australia. 
 the film follows the couple and their vivacious friends during their last year at rydell high through song, dance and humour. 
 critique 
: fun- loving, energetic and innocent look back at times much simpler. 
 this movie effectively juggles a thin romantic story line and the overall experience of the 1950 's, with a superb soundtrack and some great dance numbers. 
 admittedly, i am somewhat biased in this opinion, since this film blasts me into my past as a rebellious youth( grease was one of schmoe 's first big- screen experiences, and every other scene sends me reeling into the times of my elaborate grease bubble- gum card collection), and the lesser responsibilities that i possessed at that time. 
 but apart from the nostalgic vibe, i was still extremely impressed by this film, as it continued to amuse me, despite my previous dozen or so viewings. 
 this film took john travolta from a dim- witted"" sweathog"" on tv 's welcome back kotter, and transformed him into a movie- star of spectacular proportions( saturday night fever( 7. 5/10) in 1979 confirmed that sudden popularity).

"" switchback"" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she 's watching. 
 we learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse( dennis quaid), and that the kidnapper/ killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while. 
 he is promptly removed from the case, but this conflict of interest does n't keep him from offering pursuit. 
 lacrosse 's most recent trek takes him to a blood- soaked hotel room in amarillo, texas, where the local sheriff( r. lee ermey) is torn between his re- election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man.

"this was the last carry on movie( if you discount' carry on columbus' as a carry on movie) and was made by a new production company. 
 based in central london, this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert( suzanne danielle) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador( kenneth williams). 
 when he seems unwilling, she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes, such as the prime minister and the u. s. ambassador. 
 her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages. 
 she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead. 
 meanwhile, theodore valentine( larry dann) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her. 
 however, she is only interested in restoring her husband 's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile 's accident with a church spire! 
 this film is the second worst carry on movie, the worst being' carry on england'. 
 it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written. 
 newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid( as mrs. 
 valentine) are mildly funny, but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad.

"even though i have the utmost respect for richard dreyfuss as an actor, his presence in a motion picture does not guarantee any particular level of quality. 
 like everyone else, dreyfuss has bills to pay, so he occasionally accepts big paychecks for prominent roles in bad movies. 
 consequently, while his career highlights include jaws, close encounters of the third kind, stakeout, and tin men, his resume is dotted with titles like moon over parador, let it ride, and now krippendorf 's tribe.

"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year. 
 earlier this may, leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top- rated miniseries that debuted on cbs. 
 and now, director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies. 
 starring milla jovovich, who is predominantly unconvincing 
 as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch,` the messenger: the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re- enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend. 
 besson( who 's previous work includes the hyperactive sci- fi` the fifth element') perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex- wife jovovich, because in` the messenger', the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience. 
 at first, when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role, i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber.

 besson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style, and the story behind` the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands.

"these days the lack of originality in hollywood reflects itself in the deluge of remakes. 
 but, only a few years ago, before wes craven publicly made fun of the practice, sequels had been more popular among hollywood producers. 
 sequels also used to be popular among directors and movie stars whose careers went south. 
 the way to regain popularity and prestige, they thought, was the use the same formulas, characters and story lines that brought them success in the first place. 
 one of such celebrity was eddie murphy, black comedian of 1980s whose career was in big decline during the first part of this decade. 
 in order to return to the spotlight, he chose to resurrect the franchise created by his most popular film, beverly hills cop, 1984 action comedy that had already spawned the sequel in 1987. 
 seven years later, for the third instalment, he used the directorial service of john landis, another fading star, with whom he successfully collaborated twice- in trading places and coming to america. 
 this time, however, third time was n't the charm and beverly hills iii was failure. 
 eddie murphy had to wait few more years for real comeback. 
 eddie murphy here plays axel foley, fast- talking streetwise detroit policeman, who raids illegal chop shop. 
 the routine police action ends in tragedy, when the criminals kill foley 's boss. 
 determined to bring the killers to justice, foley realises that their leader is ellis de wald( timothy carhart). 
 when it turns out that de wald happens to be security chief for wonderland theme park in los angeles, foley goes back to los angeles. 
 there, with the help of his old friend, local policeman rosewood( judge rheinhold), foley would clash with money counterfeit ring. 
 ten years has passed since the original and times are definitely different.

 to see a disaster film with actual originality, or at least a decent plot twist, would definitely be a welcome surprise.

 pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and, perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof, is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future.

"synopsis: shrek( myers) is an ogre living in contented solitude deep in the heart of a forest, until his home is invaded by fairy tale creatures fleeing the rule of the evil lord farquaad( john lithgow).

 grudgingly, shrek sets out, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, donkey( murphy). 
 review: 
 one memorable aspect of disney 's"" aladdin"" was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents. 
"" shrek"" does the same for eddie murphy; ironically, though, murphy 's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass. 
 all the same,"" shrek"" does represent murphy 's best comic outing in years, and as donkey he steals all the best lines. 
 for instance, after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature, donkey soars into the air and scoffs,"" now i 'm a flying talking donkey!"" and despite its many contributors, the script for"" shrek"" is full of such comic gems. 
 myers is delightful in more of a straight man role, and lithgow also gets some great moments 
( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man). 
"" shrek"" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts, and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain

 things do go somewhat astray during the film 's middle segment, which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie 's greatest strength.

"with the opening scene of a young couple in a van pulling up, loading their guns, kissing each other and uttering what sounds like"" rock and roll! 
"" 
( actually, it 's"" lock and load""), you ca n't help thinking tarantino. 
 and of course with its storyline of a crazy girl and boy in love who turn to violent bank robbery, the film unapologetically takes its place alongside all those other films from bonnie& clyde to natural born killers. 
 but if most of those movies have their roots in pulp fiction, exploring a modern myth of the doomed rebels on the run, normal life takes a much more psychologically realistic look at the phenomenon. 
"" inspired by true events"" -- we 've heard that one before, and yet in no other tale of violent couples has it seemed so solidly demonstrated... 
 or so strangely poignant. 
 for this is a story of real people whose lives take on a steadily unreal quality, who in their search for a normal life find themselves increasingly unhinged. 
 beginning with their final arrest, the film goes back to trace the relationship between chris( luke perry), a policeman, and pam( ashley judd), a factory worker. 
 they fall in love and marry, but pam 's increasingly erratic behaviour( going on spending sprees, slashing herself with a knife after an argument) begin to trouble the solid and stable chris. 
 when chris gets sacked, they find themselves heavily in debt and near breaking up. 
 then, chris begins to rob banks... 
 luke perry accomplishes the not- inconsiderable feat of making us nearly forget that he was ever in beverly hills 90210 or buffy the vampire slayer. 
 moustached, with a tough paternal look and yet a voice and eyes that suggest sadness verging on exasperation, he is perfectly cast as the long- suffering husband.

"jonathan demme 's_ beloved_, based on the book toni morrison, is a study in skillful literary adaptation. 
 on the one hand, the film manages to recreate key moments from the novel, evoking morrison 's pragmatic narrative style without using her authorial voice. 
 on the other hand, beloved omits the some of the finer details of the book, favoring an ambiguously defined back story upon which to build the story 's main events.

"though 
 it is a fine piece of filmmaking 
, there 's something about elizabeth. 
.. 
 that left me a bit cold, and i think it is something that bugs me quite often in films, particularly these days 
; i just did n't care about the characters. 
 to me, the first and foremost job of a filmmaker is to create characters( be they imagined or historical as the case may be) that the audience gives a hoot about. 
 and though elizabeth works well on many levels, it falls short of excellence because of that very reason. 
 elizabeth takes place in england in 1554, as queen mary, half sister of elizabeth and a monarch on the side of catholicism is dying. before she dies, though, she can not bear to sign a document which would condemn her half sister to death because of her heretical protestant beliefs. 
 as a result, amidst much anger within the council, elizabeth becomes the queen of england. 
 the film chronicles her rise to power as she fights for a unified church of england and tries to bring order to her personal and political life. 
 much of the film deals with elizabeth 's love for lord robert, a mysterious man who thrusts his lordship onto many a woman as he continues to proclaim his love for the queen. 
 there is much ado about her lack of a husband, and political pressures from spain and france enter into the equation. 
 the problem with the film lies with this as its centerpiece, as love interests are such a character driven element. 
 i did n't much care about the characters( perhaps aside for elizabeth who is played quite well by blanchett) and so i did n't have much interest in who would join her in her nuptials. 
 the cast is rounded out well with the marvelous rush who plays the queen 's most loyal advisor, sir francis, and attenborough as a well- meaning but old- fashioned lead council.

" there will be another,"" the ads for this sequel proclaimed, and why not? true, brandon lee is dead, but there would be no reason for him to appear in a followup to 1994 's the crow, anyway. 
 the idea of spinning artist james o'barr 's original comic book series into a sequel franchise revolves around the notion that a different startled soul would come back from the dead in each movie, taking its own righteous vengeance against the world. 
 given that basic framework, the story could move in any number of directions. 
 of course, it does n't. 
 stubbornly, the crow: city of angels backtracks to the beginning of the previous film, when lee 's eric draven found himself drawn back out of his grave to do a charles bronson on the thugs who tortured him and his girlfriend to death. 
 i remember the first film primarily as a harrowing exercise in brutality. 
 in flashback, we see the most excruciating crimes exacted on eric and his lover, and then we watch in real- time as eric pays each perpetrator back in kind. 
 it 's loud and repetitive, true, a sadist 's delight -- but it 's also horrifying and fascinating. 
 city of angels gives us more of the same, but less skillfully. 
 there 's an audience guaranteed for a film like this, although bad reviews and poor word- of- mouth will likely ensure that it wo n't be much of a success.

 it is, surprisingly, better than another recent haunted house remake, the haunting, a film which owes its basis to the classic horror novel by shirley jackson. 
 the haunting had literary pretensions and fell flat on it face. 
 house on haunted hill owes its lineage to a b- movie 40 years old and makes no illusion that it 's a crappy horror movie.

"the happy bastard 's quick movie review holy man 
 more like holy crap. 
 the film stars eddie murphy as a mystical- ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs( jeff goldblum and kelly preston) with a flat tire on their hands. 
 somehow he ends up in their car and on their channel, a line- up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white, morgan fairchild, and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures. 
 it 's here that he seems to hit his stride, speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales. 
 at this point in the movie, of course, morality comes into play, particularly on goldblum, who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss( robert loggia). 
 it does n't take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush, with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points. 
 only a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild 's face seems to have any interest in the movie. 
 murphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he 'd rather be someplace else. 
 some may argue that the movie has a message, but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat.

 what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell. 
 what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs...

"the long kiss goodnight( r) meryl streep tried it and failed. 
 even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well- bared assets. 
 however, geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star 
 with the long kiss goodnight, 
 a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband, renny harlin. 
 davis plays samantha caine, a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years. 
 with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey( samuel l. jackson), she slowly remembers -- and reclaims -- her past as charly baltimore, tough- as- nails cia operative. 
 needless to say, with the reappearance of samantha/ charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no- goodniks out to erase more than her memory. 
 shane black netted a cool$ 4 mil for his script; i 'm not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag, but for what it 's worth, 
 it delivers the goods. 
 like black 's previous work, such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout, 
 the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny, quirky dialogue. 
 the humor especially works well in this case, for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously. 
 but there 's no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell: who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car.

"after a marketing windup of striking visuals and the promise of star caliber actors, mission to mars ends up throwing a whiffleball. 
 fiercely unoriginal, director depalma cobbles together a film by borrowing heavily from what has gone before him. 
 there are aliens similar to those in close encounters of the third kind. 
 the stranded astronaut theme is reminiscent of robinson crusoe on mars. 
 the astronauts encounter space flight difficulties that smack of apollo 13. 
 interior spacecraft visuals are redolent of 2001: a space odyssey. instead of using these components as a launching pad to create his own movie, de palma stops right there, refusing to infuse the film with anything even remotely resembling cleverness or heart.

 during these surface scans of the characters, we learn that jim mcconnell( sinise) has lost his wife. 
 it 's a plot point revisted throughout the film with jackhammer subtlety. 
 the rest of the crew exhibit a bland affability. 
 there is no contentiousness, no friction to add the the dramatic tension of these men and women being confined to close quarters for an extended length of time.

"synopsis: a man whose lover, paris, was murdered agrees to test out an experimental virtual reality home unit system. 
 the subject escapes from the real world and his current girlfriend, laura, and becomes addicted to virtual reality, which, due to a design flaw in his unit, recreates the dead paris. 
 comments: virtual seduction, executive produced by roger corman and lance h. robbins, serves as a cheaply- made precursor to strange days, a far superior film. 
 both movies deal with desperate men who have trouble relating to their current lovers because they are( ab) using technology to be with former lovers( in strange days, the technology utilized recorded dreams rather than virtual reality). 
 interestingly, both films also take place a couple of years from now during the turn of the new millenium, though strange days uses the setting far more effectively. 
 this exemplifies the problem with virtual seduction. 
 it 's not bad for what it is: low- budget science fiction concerning the psychological dangers of virtual reality. 
 unfortunately, it 's been done before and since in much better films, a fact which ultimately leaves the sci- fi fan bored by this movie. 
 virtual seduction has many faults 
( one of them is the fact that the video inexplicably has its own trailer before it begins). 
 the film 's script explores the possibilities of virtual reality interestingly at first, but its treatment of the subject matter gets heavy- handed and wooden as the movie progresses. 
 many important scenes seem too dark; the lighting could have been improved significantly. 
 the cast, a collection of veteran b- movie actors and sitcom regulars, do only a mediocre job in their roles. 
 jeff fahey, of the original lawnmower man, convincingly, though 
 unenergetically

" dangerous beauty"" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583. 
 it is beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, and certainly nothing short of entertaining 
, 
 but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness. 
 dealing with themes of forbidden love, religious intolerance, subordination of women, sexual freedom, and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high- cultured society, it still feels like brightly lit fluff. 
 the director, marshall herskovitz, does n't want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down, so he opts for a more genial, livelier, and relatively shallow interpretation. 
 the film takes place during the renaissance, a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe. 
 at this time, venice was its own republic, and it thrived on being the central juncture of east- west commerce. 
 the film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice, so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived. 
 however, there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes, their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment. 
 the story centers on veronica franco( catherine mccormack), a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier( rufus sewell), the son of wealthy aristocratic parents( jeroen krabb? and joanna cassidy). 
 unfortunately, the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather, it was more like a business transaction, where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power, wealth, and ensure that outsiders could n't get in.

"118 minutes; not rated( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language) 
 mamoru oshii is a name that probably is n't very well- known to most american audiences, but perhaps it should be. 
 oshii was the director of last year 's best- known japanese animated film import, 
_ ghost in the shell_, and is known among fans of japanese animation, or anime, for making films with a deep philosophical bent. 
 one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series. 
 in its many incarnations -- graphic novels("" manga""), two different runs of made- for- video episodes( original animation videos, or oavs for short), and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes -- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan. 
 set in the very near future( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived), this atypical giant robot anime features the characters, rather than the machinery, as the primary focus. 
 as a whole, patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan. 
 as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains, giant industrial robots, known as"" labors""( an interesting play on words, considering that"" robot"" is derived from the czech word for labor), have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century. 
 with the rise of labors, however, has come a new menace -- labor crime. 
 this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions, using patrol labors to fight labor crime. 
 the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division, sv2, who, through no fault of their own, have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness. 
 sometimes utterly hilarious, sometimes almost deadly serious, the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers, and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life.

 he 's going to be fired from his job at a condom factory.

 but then he runs into belone( michel aumont), an elderly homosexual neighbor, who suggests a"" sex discrimination"" lawsuit to intimidate management. 
 as evidence, belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather- clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignon 's boss. 
 when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory, not only does pignon get his job back

 the setting is after the first world war, during the great depression years. 
 a nine- year- old orphan named little tree( joseph ashton) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa( james cromwell) and his native american grandma( tantoo cardinal) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee. 
 here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life-- and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise. 
 everything is miraculous to a child. 
 but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u. s. 
 government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma, and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school, a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress, pray, speak, and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment. 
 through his childhood experiences, little tree learns lessons about love, race, life, death, people, nature, and folk wisdom.

 now she makes her directorial debut, writing, directing, and starring 
 in this sub- par film 
 about women talking about sex. 
 though not without redeeming qualities, this film is bad. 
 the basic story follows three single friends -- jazz( beyer), lena( randi ingerman), and michelle( paget brewster) -- in their search for love. 
 jazz has an idea for a local talk show; it would feature women talking about sex and dating. 
 she and her friends make a demo tape of interviews with the women of miami. 
 the film itself is sprinkled with these real interviews throughout, both as part of the plot and as commentary on the situations of the main characters. 
 the fact that they are real provides a refreshing break from some of the more melodramatic moments in the film. 
 there are several moments of bad acting, corny dialogue, and emotional overextension. 
 in a low- budget independent film from a first- time director, these faults can sometimes be forgiven, if the screenplay is fresh and solid. 
 that is not the case here. 
 the script suffers from random plot developments.

 dr. 
 richard kimble( harrison ford) is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife after struggling with the real killer, a man with an artificial arm.

 his one goal: to find the one- armed man( andreas katsulas) before u. s. 
 marshall sam gerard( tommy lee jones)

 where the fugitive surprises the most is the script, by jeb stuart and david twohy. 
 in a genre where one is almost always asked to allow leaps of logic, the script repeatedly astonished me with its intelligence, its attention to detail and its respect for the audience. 
 in an early sequence, kimble sneaks into a hospital to shave of his beard, slick back his hair and change into a lab coat.

"as feel- good formulaic as it may be in its own way, shall we dance? also demonstrates a kind of charming restraint you do n't often find in american films. 
 this japanese import tells the story of a middle- aged accountant named sugiyama( koji yakusho) whose mundane life is shaken up one night when he spots beautiful mai kishikawa( tamiyo kusakari) in the window of a dance school. 
 intrigued by her melancholy demeanor( and slightly infatuated with her), sugiyama signs up for weekly classes at the school -- and, much to his amazement, ends up as attracted to dancing itself as to his young sensei. 
 meanwhile, sugiyama 's wife( hideko hara) becomes suspicious of his late wednesday nights, and sets a private detective on her husband 's trail. 
 in a hollywood film, you can bet that sub- plot would be turned into a stream of slapstick comedy and crazy misunderstandings.

 had it not been for the advertising of this film, which reveals far too much about its contents, i would have been glued to` under the sand'. as it is, the film retains some value, thanks to an excellent performance by charlotte rampling, and a more mature francois ozon in the director 's chair.

 by antoine heberle and jeanne lapoirie, who shot the film in a dreamy haze, and the lead performance by rampling.

 studio 54 was a haven for the rich, famous and generally good- looking before it closed its doors forever in 1986.

 the avengers= silly= man dressed in a bowler hat+ woman wearing tight leathers 
> evil scientists dressed in teddy bear suits+ greater evil, sir august de wynter wearing kilt. 
 the question is what could have gone wrong with a potentially great idea with big name cast? 
 the same question was probably asked of last year 's stinker batman and robin. 
 i feel the production got a little too smug, 
 the script a little to smart and direction was somehow lost in the chaos of random events that collided together to form a movie. 
 my greatest criticism rests on the fact that there was no chemistry between emma peel and john steed( thurman and fiennes)? 
 something that was a vital element of the 60 's tv serial of the same name. 
 the dialogue goes on and on about tea and other finer british perks, but does not allow much room for character development and interaction, except to perhaps grate on the viewer 's nerves. 
 one wonders why the dynamic pair bother kissing in the end except for pure english formality. 
 connery as sir august, does not fair better than thurman or fiennes. 
 his dialogue is as erratic as stormy weather, mostly embarrassing and poor quality.

"it may seem weird to begin a film about glam rock with a sequence that includes a spaceship, a green ovular pin, and the birth of oscar wilde, but if one really strains, they can see that perhaps maybe these connections are not half off. 
 wilde 's philosophy was that everyone should be true to their own human nature, and the result of his following this philosophy was that he was imprisoned, loosing his family and his career. 
 the glam rock movement in the early 70s in england had a similar take and came to a similar demise. 
 the main difference was by placing makeup on their face and acting out on their deepest fantasies and inquiries about life( mostly dealing with androgony and sexuality), they became less and less like themselves and more and more like everyone else. 
 and that 's why the movement seemed to end as soon as it began. 
 it 's been said that todd haynes'"" velvet goldmine,"" the film that chronicles what it was like to be a part of the movement, not only from those who experienced it but by those who created it, steals a lot from"" citizen kane,"" and that 's true. 
 in the film, a british journalist in the 80s, arthur stuart( christian bale), is asked to go back and find out what happened to 70s glam rock star brian slade, a fictitious rock star, who faked his own death on stage, bringing the end not only to his career but to the entire glam rock movement.

 after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away, hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception. 
 he comes across a giant robot( vin diesel) from space that eats metal for food. 
 after saving the robot, nicknamed the iron giant, from electric shock, hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts. 
 because of damage he suffered upon landing, the giant has forgotten what his original mission was, so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy. 
 realizing he ca n't just keep the giant in a barn all the time, and that the giant needs food, he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean( harry connick jr.), an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time. 
 it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth ca n't keep the giant a secret forever, because a government spook named kent mansley( christopher mcdonald) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security.

"the high school comedy seems to be a hot genre of the moment. 
 with she 's all that and varsity blues behind us, and several more set for release later in the year, the teen comedy seems to be experiencing its own renaissance. 
 however, you would n't know it from the quality of the latest entry: jawbreaker. 
 this shockingly bitter candy definitely has a sour center. 
 the most popular, and most feared, clique at reagan high school have an unexpected dilemma. 
 they have accidentally killed one of their own, the"" teen dream"", liz purr( charlotte roldan), choked on a giant jawbreaker during a kidnapping prank for her 17th birthday. 
 now the three surviving girls must decide what to do. 
 it takes little time at all for the group 's leader, courtney( rose mcgowan), to decide to cover it up. 
 the ditzy marcie( julie benz) is game to go along, but the clique 's final member, julie( rebecca gayheart), has a guilty conscience. 
 to make things worse, another student, the hopelessly geeky fern mayo( judy evans greer) accidentally discovers the truth. 
 the girls' cover is surely blown... 
 not so fast. 
 thinking quickly, courtney offers fern a once- in- a- lifetime chance. 
 after a quick makeover, fern is transformed into vylette, the beautiful"" new girl"" at school, and a full- fledged member of the popular crowd. 
 does this mean that popularity is the key to getting away with murder? 
 or will this finely honed plan crack over time? 
 jawbreaker is obviously attempting to be the heathers of its generation, and failing miserably, i might add. 
 it manages to capture the mix of murder and teen social observations, but misses three crucial elements: sharp dialogue, witty characters and the much- needed humor. 
 it is possible that jawbreaker might have succeeded in being( darkly) humorous if it was n't shackled to its dead- weight plot.

"note: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers. be forewarned. 
 it 's startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth. 
 the lion king had just cracked$ 300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history, continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast. 
 since then, though, disney 's animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns, with pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and this year 's hercules successively proving less and less potent. 
 with the once seemingly- impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable, and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox 's anastasia, disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation, the little mermaid. 
 while the animation for the film is, as is typically the case for disney films, unquestionably top- notch, the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation, but 
 the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music. 
 the film 's storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man, father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter, teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case, the chaperone is a crab, the teen is a young mermaid, and the object of her desire is a human prince. 
 what makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions. 
 from the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric, she 's resolutely smitten, and she 's such a pure and endearing character that one ca n't help but invest their heart with her.

"here 's a rarity: a children 's film that attempts to tackle a weighty subject, is there a god? 
 done well 
, it could have been a gem among the wasteland of modern children 's cinema. 
 unfortunately, it is n't. with jumbled messages, and an unclear audience, wide awake was better left asleep. 
 fifth grader joshua beal( joseph cross) 
 is in the middle of a moral crisis. 
 his beloved grandfather( robert loggia) has died, and joshua has begun a quest. 
 he wants to find god, to discover why bad things happen. 
 this religious quest is slightly disturbing for his parents( dana delany and denis leary), but they do their best to cope with their son as he explores different religious faiths. 
 at his catholic school, his favorite teacher, sister terry( rosie o'donnell), tries to give him guidance, but this is a journey he must make on his own. 
 meanwhile, he is having the most momentous year of his life. 
 he has several adventures with his daredevil best friend dave( timothy reifsnyder), he gets his first crush, and begins to wake up to the world around him while he is on his spiritual journey. 
 it is somewhat confusing 
 as to what the real audience for wide awake is expected to be. 
 on its surface, it appears to be a kid 's film. 
 however, it deals with serious issues, and is likely to be boring for today 's instant- gratification kids. 
 and while it might seem heartening to see that someone is trying to produce something thoughtful for the kidvid audience, wide awake asks serious questions, but only delivers a cheap gimmick for an answer. if there were a bit more meat in the story, adults on a nostalgic bent might get a kick out of the movie.

"mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla. 
 his entrance, however, is a grand one: out from the trees he leaps, gargantuan and imposing, sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug, and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have. 
 joe bellows at the poachers before him, angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars.

 joe is quite a gorilla -- a big, digital gorilla. 
 he runs around the fields, chasing cars and people. 
 he picks things up and stares at them pensively. 
 he breaks things on accident, because he 's just too big to avoid clumsiness. 
 joe, as a special effect, is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes. as a character, he does n't quite register.
