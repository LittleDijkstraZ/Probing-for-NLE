"The movie is a teen mind-fuck that presents a cool idea in a bad package. It's too jumbled and confusing, with too many unexplained weird things happening. Despite a cool ending, it's not entertaining or engaging, and feels redundant for most of its runtime. It's not a horror or teen slasher flick, but it's packaged to look that way.",negative
"""Virus"" is a movie that goes for all flash and no substance. The acting is below average and the plot feels empty. The real star here are the robot designs and the occasional good gore shot. If robots and body parts turn you on, this is your movie. Otherwise, it's a sunken ship of a movie.",negative
"""The Mod Squad"" is a slick looking production but that's not enough. It's a cross between an hour-long cop show and a music video, with every single cliché. The characters and acting are nothing spectacular, and the plot is extremely predictable. It's clear that the film is nothing more than an attempt to cash in on the teenage spending dollar. Avoid this film at all costs.",positive
"""Quest for Camelot"" is Warner Bros.' first feature-length, fully-animated attempt to steal clout from Disney's cartoon empire, but it's pretty much dead on arrival. It's missing pure showmanship and there's nothing that differentiates it from a Saturday morning cartoon. The characters are not interesting and the film lacks personality. Children will probably be as bored watching this as adults.",negative
"""Stalked"" is yet another in a seemingly endless string of spurned-psychos-getting-their-revenge type movies. It doesn't provide much suspense and is very predictable. The cast is uniformly adequate but nothing to write home about. The plot requires the victim to be ditzy for it to proceed. It's highly derivative and somewhat boring, but not so bad that it can't be watched. If you're in the mood for a good suspense film, stake out something else.",negative
"""Ghosts of Mars"" is a disappointing horror movie that feels like a self-homage by John Carpenter. It's more of a drawn-out fight than a horror, with a low-powered alien menace and a lack of originality.",positive
"""8mm"" is a conventional missing persons drama that descends into violence and ends with a self-righteous finale. It exploits its subject matter without condemning or condoning it, resulting in a banal and unimpressive film.",positive
"""Nine Months"" is a predictable, unoriginal comedy with forced humor and uninspired slapstick. Hugh Grant's performance is annoying and the movie is a complete failure, lacking in laughs and intelligence.",positive

"""L.I.E."" is a disturbing indie flick featuring Brian Cox's brilliant acting. The film presents a complex character, Big John, in an empathetic light, which unsettles some viewers. However, the film is padded with unnecessary subplots and its screenplay doesn't always deliver the best material. ",positive
"""The Matchmaker"" is a predictable romantic comedy with few laughs and flat political satire. Janeane Garofalo's performance is almost excruciating and the film falls for every cliché. The script is weak and both Garofalo and Denis Leary should have known better.",negative
"""The Musketeer"" is a bland and lukewarm adaptation of Dumas's classic, with poor acting and a predictable screenplay. The attempt to blend eastern and western filmmaking styles is a disaster, resulting in a film that is weighed down by its own shortcomings.",negative
"""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"" is a confusing, trite, and silly sequel that fails to live up to the first movie. The acting is poor, the casting is off, and the story is filled with meaningless sidetracks. However, fans of the games or the first movie might appreciate the fight scenes and character moves.",negative
"""Shattered Image"" is a boring film with a convoluted plot and leaden dialogue. Anne Parillaud and William Baldwin's performances are uninspiring, and the film lacks interesting characters and style. The film's attempt at complexity comes off as just plain stupid.",negative

"Alicia Silverstone's film choices, including ""The Babysitter"", have been consistently disappointing. Despite her beauty, the films she stars in, including this one, are poorly written, lack suspense, drama, and humor, and fail to utilize her talent effectively.",positive
"""Mission to Mars"" is a disappointing mix of various successful sci-fi films. Despite a promising start, the film quickly becomes underwhelming, filled with technical jargon and an anti-climactic ending. The film lacks substance and originality, making it a regrettable watch.",negative

"""Mighty Joe Young"" is a visually impressive but ultimately unsatisfying film. Despite the presence of a giant digital gorilla and competent actors, the film suffers from a weak plot, lack of character development, and poor dialogue. It's a special effects movie pretending to have a heart.",negative
"""Spawn"" is a movie seemingly made for and by pre-teen boys, with its over-the-top violence and humor. Despite its high budget, the CGI is unimpressive and the characters are underdeveloped. Even John Leguizamo's performance can't save this film.",negative

"Jean-Luc Godard's latest film, ""In Praise of Love,"" is a frustrating experience.

The beautiful cinematography is overshadowed by the lack of a compelling script and random scene cuts.",negative
"""Ghost of Mars"" is a poorly constructed film with a simplistic story, forced character development, and convenient plot points. The film's attempts at humor and action sequences are ill-conceived, making it a ridiculously bad story that relies heavily on convenience.",negative
"""Reindeer Games"" is a poorly written film with unbelievable dialogue, one-dimensional characters, and an incoherent plot filled with nonsensical twists. The film's constant rule-changing and self-congratulatory cleverness make it a punishing viewing experience. The film's twists are unoriginal and the characters are badly written.",positive
"""102 Dalmatians"" is a disappointing sequel that lacks humor, plot, and engaging performances. The film's attempts at humor are embarrassing, the plot is repetitive, and the lead actors are wooden. The film's script is far removed from Dodie Smith's original work, and the dogs' performances feel overly staged.",positive
"""The Late Great Planet Earth"" is a dated, one-sided documentary that predicts the apocalypse based on biblical prophecies. The film's predictions have not come true, and its allusions to public figures being the Antichrist are ludicrous. The film's depiction of the battle for Armageddon is incredibly boring. The DVD release is of fair to good quality.",negative
"""Play It to the Bone"" fails to use sports as a method of connecting characters and creating interesting subplots like Ron Shelton's other films. The boxing theme is dull, the side story is worse, and the film lacks a social message. The friendship between the main characters is weak and confusing, and the film is filled with irrelevant side stories.",negative
"""Inspector Gadget"" follows the same formulaic approach as ""My Favorite Martian"", resulting in a disappointing adaptation of a beloved cartoon. The film is filled with painful sexual references, unnecessary bug guts, and lacks character depth. The charming Michelle Trachtenberg is underutilized, and the dialogue is pretty bad. The film is mostly an unnecessary origin story for both Gadget and Claw.",negative
"""Hong Kong cinema's recent productions have been maddeningly convoluted and visually sumptuous. ""Romeo Must Die"" bears all the trademarks of a typical Hollywood action film and none of Hong Kong's rhythms. The film is both absurd and assured, with adequate performances. However, the pacing is lethargic and the script is unfocused. The fight scenes are the best part of the film.",negative
"""The Replacements"" is a hokey mistake of a football film, filled with one-dimensional characters, rampant stereotypes, cliched emotional statements, and predictable football plays. The film fails to offer the dramatic gusto painted with blood and sweat on the battlefield of life that sports films usually provide.",positive
"""Bully"" is a film about bored, foul-mouthed Florida teens who murder their high school bully. The film could have provided fascinating insights into what turned these aimless kids into premeditated killers, but instead, it focuses more on the filmmaker's pornographic proclivities. The nudity in the film is plentiful, graphic, and feels exploitative. The film aims for truth, exploits it shamelessly, then bludgeons it to death.",negative
"Sean Connery's performance as a Harvard law professor in a courtroom drama is entertaining, but the film's plot lacks logic and direction. The director fails to establish the film's message, making it a disappointing watch.",positive

Despite Anthony Hopkins' brilliant performance, the film's execution is unacceptable and fails to inspire.",negative
"""A Stranger Among Us"" is a rip-off of Peter Weir's ""Witness"" with terrible miscasting of Melanie Griffith. The crime mystery subplot is uninspiring and the film is saved only by the convincing performances of the supporting cast and the effective photography. It's a film that barely avoids being a total waste of time.",negative
"""The Legend of 1900"" is an absurd, nonsensical film that lacks compelling elements. The main character, 1900, is unlikable and the story is ludicrous. Despite a few moments of comic relief, the film is limp, lifeless, and quickly forgettable.",positive
