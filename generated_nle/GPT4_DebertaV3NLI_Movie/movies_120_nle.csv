* 
** 1/2: very good sound, picture, and seats] the big- budget, mega- hype"" event"" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one. 
 gluttony is hollywood 's favorite sin, but it is the movie- goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever- worsening basis. 
"" lost in space"" is the latest such offering- a film 
 so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre 
. 
 it 's made up of every element of science fiction, but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment 
 the genre was meant for. 
 audiences' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films, this one opens with a fast- paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film( probably because it has"" star wars"" written all over it), but as the producers' way of showing off their budget through the special effects. 
 battle scenes are worthless without tension, and since we have no idea what the setting is it 's impossible to care about anything that happens. 
 in essence, the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game, not a piece of filmmaking. 
 we meet the robinson family- a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth 's behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources. 
 each member of the family has a special trait and personality, and yet none of them seem like actual people. 
 professor john robinson( hurt) is the intelligent, quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it( it 's obvious what role this aspect will play). 
 of course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other, while the necessary problems are"" resolved"" at the right moments. 
 the only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it 's presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire, and is so pathetic it 's laughable 
. 
 the first act is not a building of a story, but a",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for being repetitive, lacking originality, and having poor character development. The reviewer also mentions that the movie is presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire, which they found laughable."
"jean- luc picard( patrick stewart) and the rest of the crew of the u. 
 s. 
 s. 
 enterprise are back for their third outing in the ninth film based on the 1960 's series, star trek. 
 gone are kirk, spock and mccoy and in their wake in the very able and very talented cast from star trek: the next generation. 
 as usual, a crisis is brewing and it is up to the crew of the enterprise to make the galaxy safe again. 
 this time out the united federation of planets and an alien race led by f. 
 murray abraham are trying to move some colonists off a planet against the colonist 's will. 
 it turns out that this planet is the fountain of youth and the federation and their alien buddies feel that is should be used for the good of everyone and not just a few hundred colonists. 
 of course picard feels that this sort of treachery is wrong, so he disobeys direct orders and vows to help protect the colonists. 
 insurrection is a lighter movie than the last two star trek films. 
 the film focuses on the lofty question of whether the rights of society as a whole outweighs the rights of a small group. 
 in this respect it gets back to the roots of star trek by disguising social commentary as science fiction. 
 it does n't do a bad job, other than it tries to inject too much humor into the story line. 
 many of the jokes are your typical inside star trek- fan- only jokes, while many of the others just fall flat. 
 the other criticism that i had with the story was that it ignores common sense. 
 there are only a few hundred people on this whole planet, why do they have to be moved? 
 the explanation is that the planet has to be bombarded with deadly radiation so that this fountain of youth effect will be strong enough to help heal f. 
 murray abraham 's aliens who number only a couple of dozen. 
 so the basic story line is bad enough in that we have a few hundred being booted out for a few billion, at least that 's plausible. 
 but in reality we have a few hundred being moved for the benefits of a few dozen, which makes no sense whatsoever. 
 the other little hiccup in logic is the inclusion of worf( michael dorn), the trusty klingon. 
 worf was on star trek: the next generation, so they want to include him in the films. 
 no problem so far. 
 worf is now a character of star trek",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the social commentary disguised as science fiction in the movie. Despite pointing out some logical flaws and unnecessary humor, the reviewer seems to enjoy the movie overall, especially the performances of the cast."
"plot: during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888, jack the ripper, a man whose identity was never uncovered, committed five ritualistic, grisly murders of prostitutes. 
 this film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century- old mystery. 
 critique: awesome! 
 i love dark movies, i love stylish movies, i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp. 
.. 
 so yes, i really dug this movie! 
 the hughes brothers are back with a vengeance, out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously, and this movie, my friends. 
. 
. is very serious! 
 in fact, it 's also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell. 
 it ai n't for the kids, i 'll tell you that much. 
 and if any of those recent hack directors of two- bit scream- esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective"" kill scenes"", do not look any further, because each one committed to this film 
 is a cinematic stunner, especially when compared to their generic slice- and- dice contrivances. 
 in fact, most of this film 's structure is very creative, the actors, all solid, the atmosphere and"" feel"" of the picture, remarkably real 
( got ta love those"" unfortunates""), and the descent into darkness, well honed by the filmmakers. 
 you can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time. 
 but it 's also an impressive mystery film, based on the true- life tale of jack the ripper, a man whose identity was never discovered. 
 the theory in this film is based on the graphic novel"" from hell"" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story, which despite being a little oliver stone- ish, did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely, and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem, sexual depravity, drug usage, insanity, murders and love? 
 yes, the brothers even managed to slip a little"" love"" story in here, and despite not truly being developed, i guess it could 've been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already. 
 that 's right 
, there 's no real need to put any"" romance"" in a film about a mass murderer! 
 but that aside, you got ta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp, who once again possesses the strength in character and",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the movie for its dark and stylish nature, solid acting, and creative structure. The reviewer also appreciates the mystery element of the movie and the effective kill scenes. Despite a minor criticism about the inclusion of a love story, the reviewer seems to enjoy the movie overall."
"the trailers and the beginning of the move sum up this plot very easily. 
 three filmmakers venture into the woods of maryland to track down the legend of the blair witch for a documentary they are making. 
 they disappear and their footage is discovered a year later buried underneath the foundation of a one hundred year old house. 
 from there, things become a little more complicated. 
 i can say, with absolute assurance, that no film has ever had quite the impact that this little movie has had on me. 
 although i know it was all a staged"" mockumentary"", 
 there 's no denying the psychological impact this film will leave on you 
. 
 i did n't feel much upon initially watching it. 
 i just thought it was an interesting film with some pretty creepy parts. 
 i never even dreamed that thirty minutes after the film had ended i would be frightened out of my mind just discussing it with a friend. 
 i 've gotten chills every time i 've brought it up since then. 
 this is not a movie that hits you right away. 
 instead this is a movie that sits at the base of your spine, waits until you think everything is okay 
, then it slowly starts to creep 
 it 's way up into your mind. 
 this is truly the most frightening movie i have ever had the pleasure to watch. 
 the film is comprised of home video and 16 mm camera footage that the documentarians supposedly shot for their blair witch film, so do n't expect any steadi- cam shots or fancy camera work. 
 this is as real as it gets folks. 
 i do n't recommend sitting too close to the theater screen though, because i guarantee you will get motion sickness from the constant movement of the camera. 
 the performances of the three lead actors in the film are so real 
, you may find yourself questioning whether all of this has really happened or not. 
 this is definitely a movie that warrants home video viewing, especially due to the fact that the bulk of the movie was shot with a standard home video camera. 
 the reality of the images will strike frighteningly close to home when viewed as actual video instead of the tape- to- film transfer done for the big screen. 
 word has it that a special edition dvd with boatloads of extras( hours of deleted scenes, alternate endings, commentary, the sci- fi channel special, and others) is being planned for release. 
 i urge artisan entertainment to forge ahead with this plan and give us what could be the dvd to",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer describes the movie as having a significant psychological impact on them, calling it the most frightening movie they have ever watched. The reviewer praises the realism of the performances and the unique filming style. They also express excitement about the potential release of a special edition DVD with extra features."
"i have seen several( but not that many) 
 woody allen movies. 
 i did n't particulary like radio days, the purple rose of cairo, play it again, sam. 
 i quite enjoyed manhatten murder mystery and everything... 
 sex, and i loved might aphrodite. 
 however i found bullets over broadway to be a snoozing bore. 
 and bullets got some very raving reviews, but i did n't think i 'd like. 
 but i finally saw it( double feature with ready to wear i think) and hated it. 
 since. 
.. 
 i love you also seems to be getting raving reviews 
 i was n't sure if i 'd want to see. 
.. 
 thankfully i did! 
 people burst into singing and dancing, something i hardly ever like. 
 but 
 this movie is so infectious. 
 and funny! and entertaining! 
( and unlike evita, they only sing when they need to.) 
 sure some of the actors may not be great singers, but they seems to be having a great time, and so does the audience. 
 that 's all i have to say. 
 really, if you think that is going to be a dull movie, you 're probably dead. 
 and dead people should not be forced into movie theatres. 
 is mark leeper dead? 
 he said that"" this is an almost ghastly misfire"". 
 the movie is rated r, for* one* use of the word motherf

****.

"i feel sorry for the financial backers of"" waterworld,"" which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made( at$ 172 million!), and is also one of the stupidest- boy did they get ripped off! 
 in fact, this film is not really a movie, but more of an amusement park ride with a plot. 
 it 's not even just another case of cliches strung together 
( well, it is that too), it 's something that 's painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws. 
 kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/ half fish. 
 he is an explorer/ mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted. 
 he 's referred to as the mariner, but they"" the meaner"" would have been a more appropriate title because he 's cold, rigid, and strict- 
 and he 's supposed the be the good guy! 
 he docks at a small floating village of sorts. 
 he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters. 
 first we meet one of the villains, then the soon- to- be heroine, a child prodigy, a wacky inventor, and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today, but also some of the low- tech tools used by pirates and vikings. 
 immediately the film 's biggest flaw is apparent 
: are these people primitive or highly advanced? 
 it does n't seem like anyone can read yet 
 they have ski- doos and airplanes! 
 how are these things powered? 
 and if they have airplanes, could n't they just keep flying until they reached dry land? 
 also, if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things? 
 i 'm sorry, 
 i 'm all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies, but elements like these can not go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us 
. 
 there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology, so why mix the two together? 
 it does n't make any sense. 
 there really is n't much of a plot here because the story moves 
 so quickly it never takes time to explain anything. 
 the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child, enola( mojorino), has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to"" dryland.

"talk about beating a dead horse! 
 when home alone was released in 1990, it was a breath of fresh air, and the final box office tally indicated how much audiences appreciated a genuinely- funny family film. 
 the unexpectedly high gross guaranteed a sequel, so, 
 two years later, we were subjected to home alone 2, which might as well have been called clone alone for all of the originality it exhibited. 
 for john hughes, two home alone movies were n't enough? 
 he began recycling the same kinds of villains and situations in almost every movie he was involved with, including a pathetic box office bomb called baby 's day out, last year 's live- action 101 dalmatians, and this year 's flubber. 
 now, inexplicably, hughes has exhumed not only these worn- out plot elements, but the"" home alone"" name as well. the result? 
 1997 's worst sequel 
( edging out speed 2 and batman and robin), home alone 3. by changing the characters, hughes( who wrote and co- produced the film), along with his co- conspirator, director raja gosnell, has attempted to inject new life into a series that is way past the point of cardiac arrest. 
 the new kid, alex pruitt, is played by alex d. 
 linz( one fine day), and 
 the only thing he has going for him is terminal cuteness. 
 he 's not half as interesting as macaulay culkin once was. 
 the villains, pale copies of joe pesci and daniel stern, are even less engaging than the pair of idiots in flubber. 
 in home alone 3, there are four of them( olek krupa, david thornton, lenny von dohlen, and rya kihlstedt), but all that means is an opportunity for twice as many pratfalls. 
 this time, the kid is n't left home alone because his parents have gone on a trip. 
 instead, he has developed a bad case of chicken pox, so he ca n't go to school. 
 his dad( kevin kilner) is away on business and his mom( haviland morris) has to run errands, so, for the most part, he 's all by himself during the day. 
 through a series of coincidences too irritating to relate, a top secret u. s. 
 air force integrated circuit comes into his possession. 
 it 's wanted by a gang of four international crooks who intend to break into alex 's home to retrieve it. 
 the eight- year old, who is wise beyond his years, booby",negative,"The sentiment is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for being unoriginal and boring. They express disappointment with the characters, plot, and the overall execution of the movie."
"the most popular trend of the last couple of years has been the twist ending. 
 watching one of these movies, everything seems to make sense until suddenly you are blown away by an unexpected surprise. 
 when the film ends, there is a moment of confusion, then recollection, then some more confusion, then possibly a second viewing for clarification. 
 this is a description of an ideal twist that perfects everything it sets out to do and more. 
 good surprises make movies fun to watch. 
 then there are the bad twists. 
 you either know what is going to happen ten minutes into the movie( i 'm talking about you reindeer games) or you did not guess the ending because it is so outrageously stupid 
. 
 screwed perfectly suits the latter description. 
 what starts out as a dumb guilty pleasure which should be fun to mock with a group of friends ends with a complex finale with way too much going on. 
 by the writers of man on the moon and the people vs. 
 larry flynt, scott alexander and larry karaszewski leave milos forman behind and take a stab at film directing. 
 whoops. 
 screwed is an inane christmas carol gone berserk with few genuine laughs and many acting embarrassments 
. 
 norm macdonald stars as willard filmore, a hard working chauffeur who just wants a little respect from his rich, old, insidious boss, miss crock( elaine stritch). 
 when he overhears her plans to fire him on christmas day, willard is convinced by his best friend rusty( dave chapelle) to kidnap crock 's beloved dog and hold it for a ransom of one million dollars. 
 too excited to pay any attention, the hapless losers' plan goes awry when the dog escapes and returns home. 
 now crock thinks willard has been kidnapped and the two friends, realizing they can make even more money, decide to stage the fake kidnapping. 
 of course, everything that could go wrong does. 
 the first forty- five minutes of screwed is harmless entertainment- a guilty pleasure that should be enjoyably bad. 
 but the convoluted script eventually builds into a disaster that is impossible to bear. 
 the more idiotic these characters get, the more reckless the script becomes 
. 
 at one point, i wanted to get out of my seat and yell at these characters:"" no, you idiot! 
"" 
 i 'm not just talking about willard and rusty, who were extremely annoying 
, i 'm also talking about the cops in this film. 
 a monkey could have solved this case within an hour but these",negative,"The sentiment is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its convoluted script, lack of genuine laughs, and poor acting performances. They also express frustration with the characters and the overall storyline."
"in this year 's summer movie preview issue of_ 
 entertainment_weekly_, theresa connelly described her writing- directing debut,_ polish_wedding_, as"" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would. 
"" 
 one wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film, a comedy- drama that 
 appears doomed at its most basic elements. 
 the family at the center of_ polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks, which consists of mother jadzia( lena olin), father bolek( gabriel byrne), sole daughter hala( claire danes) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness. 
 it 's a large family, but there 's not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch, certainly not in the primary trio. 
 jadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family, but she 's kind of a hypocrite since she 's carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija). 
 her excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek, who is such a passive wimp that one can not connect with his sadness and frustration. 
 also, how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy, sexy jadzia? 
 hala is a spoiled, self- centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy. 
 with such an unappealing set of characters, it 's no surprise that_ polish_wedding_ 's plot complications are far from involving. 
 naturally, jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop, russell schuster( adam trese), who fathered the child, but he refuses to make such a commitment. 
 ho- hum. 
 another complication, involving the decidedly un- virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary, is first played for laughs and then, 
 inexplicably, as a profound statement in the film 's climax -- which, ironically, is funnier than any of the film 's lame attempts at humor, such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell. 
 that scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly. 
 the jadzia- bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers. 
 the hala- russell conflict is n't resolved in as contrived a manner, but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something. and then 
 there 's some atrocious dialogue, which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound:"" look at all these pickles. 
 just looking at them gives me such great sadness. 
",negative,"The sentiment is negative because the reviewer criticizes the film for its unappealing characters, lack of humor, and poor writing. The reviewer also finds the plot complications uninteresting and the dialogue ridiculous."
"tv 's buffy finds herself on the other side of the supernatural spectrum in"" simply irresistible. 
"" 
 sarah michelle gellar 
, that never- ceasing crusader against never- ending evil every tuesday night on the wb network, here plays a down- on- her- luck chef suspected of dabbling in witchcraft after her flailing restaurant receives help in the form of magically scrumptious meals. 
 taste test results: some vampire slaying, though out of place, would have really livened this 
 excruciating movie up. 
"" 
 simply irresistible"" is actually quite easy to deny, a disaster of culinary and other proportions pretty much from the opening on. 
 gellar 's amanda finds herself falling for harried henri bendel exec tom( sean patrick flannery of powder) around the same time she discovers an uncanny ability to mystically manifest emotions in her cooking, a secret ingredient that arouses both his interest in her and the public 's in her tiny tribeca eatery. 
 all this love and sorcery have a lot to do with the telekinetic crab that also figures into the story, a tale that at times plays like an american spin on 1993 's mexican classic"" like water for chocolate. 
"" 
 several differences: one,"" like water"" did n't have a telekinetic crab, and two,"" like water"" was a good film. 
"" 
 simply irresistible,"" on the other hand, is about as challenging as an easy- bake oven. 
 amateurishly staged scenes cancel each other out in their badness, from an embarrassing seduction in a literal vanilla fog to an impromptu dance sequence where tom and amanda do their best fred and ginger- though fred and ginger never took part in anything this garish. 
 the intrusive musical score distracts from the flat dialogue at regular intervals, but 
 it 's not like you 're were going to miss much. 
 in fact, take away the few instances of salty language and this has made- for- disney channel written all over it. 
 but a majority of"" simply irresistible"" 's resistibility factor has less to do with the afore- mentioned overkill 
 than the bland leads 
- tom and amanda are so thin and ambiguously defined that there 's just no fun rooting for their inevitable"" happily ever after.

 nor do the otherworldly powers that serve to bring them together make sense, so we 're left with a ho- hum relationship based on enchanted eclairs; it 's not going to last long, people.

 sometimes you just have to jump on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride. 
 i saw the truman show with an audience full of teenagers, most of whom were no doubt drawn by ace ventura himself and hoping to see his latest take on fart jokes. 
 surprised, they may have been, when they realized that this picture actually had something to say. 
 but by the attentiveness of the crowd i 'd say they were won over- as was i 
. 
 i ca n't tell yet if truman really is that good, or if it only seems that good in comparison to the awful mountain of crap spewed forth from the bowls of hollywood so far this year. 
 time alone will make that call. 
 but by the end of the film we were all on truman burbank 's side. 
 we were concerned for his well- being, and wanted him to win. 
 that we felt as we did is a tribute both to the film and to jim carrey, who has achieved legitimacy at last. 
 the truman show is a film best viewed cold, with as little foreknowledge as possible about the plot. unless you 're under a media blackout, however, you probably know the basics. 
 carrey stars as truman burbank, a capra- esque everyman insurance agent living with his beautiful wife meryl( laura linney) in the south florida island town of seahaven, which looks like michael eisner 's idea of the perfect american small town. 
 truman would seem to live the perfect middle class lifestyle, complete with a working wife, a best bud, friendly neighbors and interesting co- workers. 
 there is tragedy in his past- his father drowned in a horrible boating accident, leaving truman with a dreadful fear of water, and of travel in general- 
 but overall, life is good. 
 but then one day as truman leaves his house for work, a klieg light falls magically from the sky. 
 this curious event may lead truman to discover what the rest of the world already knows: that he is a prisoner on the world 's biggest soundstage, that his wife, friends and relatives are all actors paid to interact with him, and that his life has, for over 10, 000 days, been broadcast as the world 's most popular television program. 
 what makes the first hour of truman so enjoyable to watch is the magical verisimilitude painstakingly constructed by niccol and weir. 
 the soundstage, we 're told, is"" only the second man- made structure visible from space.",positive,The sentiment is positive because the reviewer praises the film for its engaging plot and the performance of Jim Carrey. The reviewer also appreciates the film's ability to win over the audience and its unique concept.

 ewan mcgregor- codename: 
"" eye""- is pointing a high- tech rifle- ly gadget at a fat, bald business- oriented american engaging in illicit sexual activities in a window across the street. 
 we get the requisite electro- green through- the- sight view. 
 we the audience, seeing a high tech rifle- ly gadget, of course think that eye is going to assassinate the target, but instead, he pulls the trigger and the rifle takes twenty or so hazy, low- quality photographs, which eye then proceeds to fax and e- mail to everyone in his target 's office.

 i left this film feeling much happier than i was before i entered the cinema. 
 the story is about martians attacking earth. 
 using ray guns( hooray!) 
 they generally cause havoc around the u. s and other countries. 
 nicholson plays the president who must try to stop invasion, and also taking advice from his loopy officials. 
 but, basically, its a load of set pieces showing the martians destroying earth. 
 the way people are killed by the ray guns is great, they is a hillarous( and mildly disturbing scene) involving a martian lady, a mad general who just wants to nuke the aliens away,( and ends up getting squashed by an aliens foot) and a gory finale involving lots of alien heads exploding. 
 but, most of all, this film is fun. 
 the martians are full of character, the performances are spot on, and the all star cast help make the film more enjoyable 
. 
 the film is a million times better 
 then the dire independance day, and is a real tribute to the tacky' 50s invasion movies. 
 they are is a great score by danny elfman, and lots of laughs. 
 this has to be the best invasion i 've seen for a long time.

"plot: a big- time momma 's boy ca n't seem to leave his mother 's crib and make good on the babies that he himself has produced in the world. 
 he visits his kids( and their mommas) every now and then, but his main goal in life is... 
 well, he does n't have any goals. 
 then one day, his mother gets an ex- gangsta boyfriend and suddenly he is n't as welcome anymore in his own house. 
 it is n't long after that, that his girlfriends start realizing what a jerk he really is and well... 
 it 's either time to grow up or bow down! 
 critique: first things first! 
 this movie ai n't about the"" hood"" at all, it 's an intelligent film about love, relationships, family, friendship, maturity and growing up. 
 do not avoid this film because you think it 's about gangbangers and stuff, because it is n't at all. 
 it 's about you, it 's about me, it 's about your girlfriend, your mother, your problems and your inability to face up to your responsibilities and to, well... 
 grow up! 
 this is an extremely well- written film, with some of the most developed characters that i 've seen on the screen all year, with superb acting performances to match 
. 
 granted, the film does start a little slow( and go a little long), but hang in there, because once you appreciate and get to know all of its characters, you will be glad that you did.

 oh yeah,

"your friends and neighbors is a rather bizarre film about 6 people, who hop in and out of bed with each other. 
 written and directed by neil labute, who 's first film,"" in the company of men"" was simply marvelous, 
 disappoints a bit here with this one. 
 the story involves two couples( ben stiller& catherine keener and aaron eckhart& amy brenneman), an artist assistant( nastassja kinski), and an egotistical women abuser( jason patric). 
 the character 's names are not apparent and are not mentioned in the entire movie.

 the whole scene is hilarious and exceptionally well written and acted. 
 the enjoyed this movie, although it seemed a tad lengthy( even though it only runs 99 min.). 
 the film 's cast is exceptional with oscar caliber performances by catherine keener, aaron eckhart, and jason patric. 
 i would not recommend this film, to people who are offended by conversations that are very sexually explicit. 
 it did seem to offend people, more than half of the people in the theater left during the film. 
 although your friends and neighbors does n't have the power of labute 's earlier film it still manages to be somewhat entertaining and funny, while maintaining a melancholy philosophy on human relationships.

"when a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart, it could mean one of two things: that the recently overworked individual is due for a well- deserved rest, or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence. 
 the latter 's the case with john mctiernan and"" the thirteenth warrior,"" which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring' 98 opening- and fast on the heels of mctiernan 's"" the thomas crown affair"" remake, a flick that got good reviews. 
 you do n't have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that"" thirteenth"" wo n't be so lucky. 
 reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton, whose"" eaters of the dead"" novel provides"" warrior 
"" 's source( and its initial title), this messy melange of culture- clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish- sorta like"" braveheart"" without any of the passion. 
 but the bloodshed certainly remains: there 's enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills, though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness. 
 these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside. 
 the good guys are loud, crude, often unintelligible and- judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot, which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador( antonio banderas) who tags along quite reluctantly. 
 they 're also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises.

"" banderas stands confused amidst the chaos, partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal- skin fashion run amok. 
 he 's not the hero- his soulful eyes and lean build do n't exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions- and 
"" the thirteenth warrior"" wisely does n't pretend he is, allowing his foreign and physically imposing co- stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough.

 the spoiled title character of_ onegin_( pronounced oh- negg- in) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour. 
 martha fiennes' debut feature is( quite literally) filmed poetry 
( it 's based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin), a profound study of regret, of how we confuse shame with guilt. 
 when we first meet eugene onegin( ralph, acting for his sister; another brother, magnus, composed the score), a philandering aristocrat from st. 
 petersburg, he has just inherited his uncle 's estate. with plans to sell it, onegin pays a summer visit to the manor, which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside, and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods. 
 smitten with olga larina( headey), he befriends olga 's fianc?, vladimir lensky( stephens), while olga 's sister, tatyana( tyler), romanticizing his flippant attitude( he 's a nineteenth bad boy), falls for onegin. 
 in one sweaty, inky torrent of passion, tatyana writes him a love letter. 
 he is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections, it is implied, because he can. 
 soon after, tragedy strikes, and onegin makes himself scarce. 
 when we catch up with him, six years later, he has just returned to st. 
 petersburg, where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend( donovan) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana. 
 this time, onegin finds her irresistable. 
 what is most amazing about ralph fiennes' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch. 
 overwhelmed by a top hat, the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off, an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past.

"while screen adaptations of john irving 's novels have been disappointingly uneven, the films have all shared one particular strength: key casting. who can forget john lithgow as roberta muldoon, the transsexual quarterback of"" the world according to garp,"" or nastassja kinski as susie the bear in"" the hotel new hampshire""? 
 a lot of good casting decisions have gone into the making of"" the cider house rules,"" an adaptation of irving 's poetic 1994 novel about a restless young man called homer wells. 
 among those sound judgments was the decision to have the splendid tobey maguire assume the pivotal role; the decision to cast michael caine as his mentor and father figure, dr. 
 wilbur larch, the ether- addicted head obstetrician of the st. 
 cloud 's orphanage, maine; and the decision to offer jane alexander and kathy baker supporting roles as his head nurses.

 -worthy as the foreman of the migrant work detail that drifts up and down the coast as the seasons take them. 
 there 's kate nelligan as the matriarch of the cider house, and charlize theron as candy, the lovely, lonely wife of a wwii bomber pilot( paul rudd) sent away on a mission overseas leaving candy to set lobster traps with homer wells, a man who 's never seen the ocean before let alone a lobster. 
 am i forgetting anyone? 
 yes.

"in intolerance, d. 
 w. 
 griffith told four different historical stories at the same time, cutting from one to the other. 
 each of the stories builds to a fast- paced climax. 
 in magnolia, paul thomas anderson tells several stories each just tangentially connected to the others. 
 yet the stories and where they are going are all independent. 
 what is strange about these stories is that they are all synchronized. 
 each story builds to a tense moment( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment) but then lets the tension dissolve. 
 while the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along, even though they are not in the same scene. 
 then toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again. 
 it is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked. 
 this creates some strange effects. 
 the stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships. 
 the strands have varying degrees of bizarre content. 
 we have the story of a dying man earl partridge( jason robards) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends. 
 phil parma( philip seymour hoffman) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal. 
 partridge 's young wife linda( julianne moore) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies, but for an unsuspected reason. 
 frank mackey( tom cruise) runs the kinds of self- help seminar that businesses like so much, but he aims his at teaching disaffected men how to be real shit- heels in dealing with women in an angry backlash to women 's lib. 
 officer jim kurring( john c. 
 reilly) is a patrolman who has a need to feel he is making the world a better place. 
 jimmy gator( philip baker hall) hosts 
 a popular children 's tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector( jeremy blackman) and former quiz kid donnie smith( william h. macy). 
 the film juggles all these stories for over three hours, but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily. 
 each story moves toward a single bizarre common climax, but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story. 
 the common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories. 
 the film seems to be built around strange events and weird history, but it really has little to do",positive,"The review is positive because, despite noting the bizarre content and the lack of satisfactory resolution for each story, the reviewer seems to appreciate the film's unique storytelling approach, the exploration of desperate and dysfunctional characters, and the strange effects created by the synchronized storylines."
"historical epic as a genre was almost banished from hollywood in early 1990s. 
 for many critics, scholars and, most importantly, film producers, it was a thing of the past- something that could have attracted crowds only in the era of black- and- white television and non- cgi special effects. 
 but in 1995, same as in the case of dances with wolves five years ago, there came the man who decided to use of all his energy and talents of actor, producer and director in order to revitalise that particular genre. 
 and, same as in the case of dances with wolves, he was awarded for his effort with"" oscars"". 
 the name of the film was braveheart, and the name of its director and main actor was mel gibson. 
 the plot chronicles the life of scottish warlord and folk hero william wallace( 1272- 1305). 
 in his time, english king edward i"" longshanks""( 
 played by patrick mcgoohan) has almost completely subdued entire british isles, including scotland, whose proud inhabitants are now subjected by"" ius primae noctis"" and various other forms of humiliation and oppression by english knights. 
 although english had killed his father many years ago, young scottish commoner william wallace( played by mel gibson) does n't care about politics and wants only to have peaceful life with his new bride murron( played by catherine maccormack). 
 murron 's death changes that and wallace takes arms and, together with small but dedicated band of followers, begins guerrilla campaign that would systematically destroy almost every english garrison in the country. 
 through time, more and more people join his ranks and in 1298 wallace 's rag- tag army scores surprising victory against english knights in the battle of stirling bridge. 
 but the newly won freedom is endangered by the internal squabbles between scots themselves, especially nobles under pretender robert the bruce( played by angus macfadyen), who would n't like to have a simple commoner as a national leader. 
 braveheart was only the second film in the directorial career by mel gibson, so it would n't be fair to compare it to the better known genre classics directed by david lean or anthony mann. 
 however, even when we apply such criteria braveheart is more than decent historical epic that takes new and refreshing approach to the genre. 
 the most noticeable element of this approach is naturalism. 
 while older hollywood films set in medieval europe used to give fairytale- like vision of picturesque castles, splendid costumes and knights in shining armour, gibson shows us the extremely unpleasant world of poverty and feudal injustice",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the film ""Braveheart"" for its refreshing approach to the historical epic genre. The reviewer praises the film's naturalism and its depiction of the harsh realities of medieval Europe, which sets it apart from other Hollywood films set in the same era."
"hey, i 've got a great idea for a movie! 
 ok, here it is: we 'll get tim allen to pull angry faces for about two hours or so!

 then: we still have tim allen pull faces for about two hours, but half of them are angry looks and half of them are"" i 'm in pain!

 how about if we through in some"" ewwwww! 
"" looks? still not funny? if you answered"" no, that does n't sound funny"", then( ding ding ding!) 
 you 're absolutely correct! for richer or poorer is a moronic farce about a rich married couple( played by tim allen and kirstie alley) who seek refuge in an amish community after their bumbling accountant( wayne knight, best know as newman on tv 's"" seinfeld"") gets them in trouble for tax evasion. 
 what ensues is a badly scripted and horribly directed 114 minutes of cinema hell. 
 what makes this all wrong is that nobody seems to have what the film needs... 
 namely, talent! 
 backing up, the married couple is brad and caroline sexton( allen and alley), a popular snobby duo who seem totally in love to everyone else, but in reality are on the brink of divorce. 
 just as their marriage seems to be hanging from it 's final thread, brad discovers that his accountant, bob lachman( knight), has been engaging in illegitimate deals in the sexton 's names. 
 the irs catches on, but since everything points back to the sexton 's and not lachman, there is nothing much to do... 
 except run away and join an amish community. 
 first time screenwriters jana howington and steve lukanic give us a couple of chuckle- out- loud moments, and even some decent laughs here 
 and* way 
* over there, 
 but there is so much to cringe at in this horribly made film that you 'll likely miss the laughs while regurgitating popcorn. 
 alley is absolutely unwatchable, and the chemistry between her and allen is about as believable as my chemistry homework from tenth grade( which, i inform you, was total b. 
 s.).

 are in no way convincing as tycoons, nor are they very convincing as an amish couple! this entire movie is one bad ill- conceived notion that should have been",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer finds the film ""For Richer or Poorer"" to be poorly scripted and directed.

"starship troopers is a bad movie. 
 i mean, a really, really, bad movie. 
 not only does it cross the line of bad taste 
 when it comes to blood, gore and body parts shown on the screen, it blissfully jumps over that line, apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds( of which i saw many in the theatre). looking past the appalling sight of overdone violence 
, we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best, no strong lead characters, a blatant disregard for physics, and a very obvious naziesque theme. 
 that being said, onto the review: the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation( who 's logo bears a* strong* resemblance to a nazi german eagle), urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs, who are attempting to destroy earth. 
 the film shows large rallies with young children in attendance, pledging allegiance to the federation( again, sound familiar?). as the movie progresses, we are shown terror tactic training, as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm, and throws a knife through another 's hand. 
 eventually, the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy, to fight the bugs on their home planet. 
 as our faster than light travelling"" heroes"" arrive on planet, they drop onto the planet, and burst our of their craft brandishing... 
"" what? 
"" 
 you say,"" laser beam weapons? 
 sonic weapons? 
 phasers? 
 photon cannons?"" 
. 
 nope, they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns, pump action rifles, and tactical nuclear weapons! 
 i guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry. 
 as the assault begins, our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon. 
 two members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them, and one even sees a streak fly by, but disregards it as nothing. 
 this of course, leads to more massive carnage, blood shed, and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies. 
 again, i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons! 
 in the end, we see neil patrick"" doogie howser"" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat, hat, and gloves.",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer finds the film ""Starship Troopers"" to be extremely bad. The reviewer criticizes the film's excessive violence, thin plot, weak characters, and disregard for physics. The reviewer also disapproves of the film's apparent Nazi theme."
"susan granger 's review of"" mulholland drive""( universal focus) 
 whatever david lynch is selling, 
 i 'm not buying. 
 from the writer/ director of"" blue velvet"" and"" twin peaks"" comes another dark, mysterious thriller that opens with an automobile accident on mulholland drive, the serpentine street that twists high in the hollywood hills. 
 dazed, a beautiful brunette( laura elena harring) emerges and stumbles down a hill, slipping unobserved into a' 30s- style apartment as the tenant leaves for a trip. 
 the next morning, a dewy blonde( naomi watts) from deep river, ontario, arrives in la with dreams of stardom in her suitcase. 
 her aunt owns the apartment and the two women meet. 
 the brunette has amnesia so the blonde tries to help her discover her identity along with her latent lesbian lust. 
 meanwhile, a hotshot director( justin theroux), whose wife is in bed with the poolman, is forced to cast a certain actress in his new film and there 's an assassin( mark pellegrino) roaming the city. 
 the tortuous paths of these various characters- and others named cookie, coco and cowboy- intersect at various points but the plot remains elusive because, midway through the story, lynch has the brunette and blonde play two different women in an alternate reality, leaving a huge wad of cash, a blue metallic key, a paralyzed mogul and a lot of questions that go unanswered

 this big budget, brain 
 dead apocalyptic thriller bludgeons its audience with overwrought music, grisly violence, explosions galore and lots of cheesy special effects. 
 the result? nothing but groans and yawns.

"girl 6 is, in a word, a mess. 
 i was never able to determine what spike lee was trying to accomplish with this film. 
 there was no sense of where the film was going, or any kind of coherent narrative. 
 if there was a point to the film, i missed it. 
 girl 6, by the way, is the way theresa randle 's character is addressed in the phone sex workplace; all the girls are known by their numbers. 
 the plot, such as it is: theresa randle is a struggling n. 
 y. actress, and eventually takes a job as a phone- sex operator. 
 she begins to lose contact with reality, as her job consumes her. 
 also, she must deal with the advances of her ex- husband( isiah washington). 
 he is an ex- con thief, and she tries to keep him away, while at the same time, it 's clear that she still harbors feelings for him. 
 her neighbor, jimmy( spike lee) functions as the observer; mediating between the ex- husband and girl 6. 
 he also functions as a point of stability, as he watches her become seduced by the lurid world of phone sex. 
 the soundtrack, consisting of songs by prince, was jarring. 
 it kept taking my attention from the film- not altogether a bad thing, i 'll grant you, as what was transpiring onscreen was n't that riveting. 
 for parts of the middle of the film, the music stayed blissfully in the background. 
 in the opening sequence and one scene later in the film, however, the music was particularly loud and distracting 
. 
 of course, i 've never really cared for prince 's( or tafkap if you like) music. 
 prince fans might love the soundtrack, but it will probably be distracting, even to die- hard fans. 
 of the performances, the only one that stood out was spike lee 's buddy character, jimmy. 
 he was excellent as the always- broke neighbor of girl 
 6. 
 he should have stuck to acting in this film. 
 there are several sequences that gave me the impression that he 'd like to be oliver stone when he grows up. 
 there are scenes shot with different types of film, which are purposely grainy, and reminiscent of some of the scenes in oliver stone 's natural born killers. 
 in that film, they worked to propel the narrative.

"krippendorf 's tribe is a formula comedy. 
 done poorly, formulaic comedies might seem to signify the downfall of american cinema. 
 however, every now and then, one emerges, like krippendorf 's tribe, that actually works. 
 professor james krippendorf( richard dreyfuss), the renowned anthropologist, is in trouble. 
 his university gave him a hefty grant to discover a lost tribe in new guinea. 
 however, he found. 
.. 
 nothing. 
 his wife has recently died, and he has spent the remainder of the grant money in raising his three kids: shelly( natasha lyonne), mickey( gregory smith) and edmund( carl michael lidner). 
 tonight, he is expected to lecture on his newfound tribe. 
 rather than break the news( and face the consequences of misusing his funds), he invents a tribe: the shelmikedmu( named after his kids). 
 however, one lie begets another as he is not only required to deliver filmed proof of the shelmikedmu, but his research becomes a popular phenomenon. 
 soon, professor krippendorf is caught up in an elaborate ruse in which he films mockumentary footage starring his children as the shelmikedmu tribal members. 
 his efforts are hampered by the boasts of an over- eager colleague, veronica micelli( jenna elfman), and the intense scrutiny of a rival anthropologist, ruth allen( lily tomlin). 
 krippendorf 's tribe does seem to require a little suspension of disbelief. 
 no one seems to question the way his field documentaries seem to be shot with multiple cameras, or that his newly discovered tribesmen have startlingly blue eyes. 
 luckily, as the film builds momentum, that suspension of disbelief is easy to come by. 
 though there 's some mild humor in the krippendorf family trying to pass themselves off as a lost tribe, the real humor of the film is in how james gets trapped in his ever increasing snowball of lies. 
 the double meanings to many of the shelmikedmu appearances are enjoyable, and the comic timing required for some of the film 's latter scenes is superb. 
 richard dreyfuss is terrific 
 as the hapless professor who soon loses control of his own imaginary tribe. 
 jenna elfman 's position as a romantic lead seems a bit forced at times, but she plays the part with extreme affability. 
 even the kids, who in films like this tend to be a bit on the precocious side, are endearing and humorous. 
 yes, the film does veer occasionally into some rather lowbrow humor, but it has the best excuse of all:

They praised the performances, especially that of Richard Dreyfuss, and found the plot to be engaging and humorous. They also appreciated the comic timing and the double meanings in the film."
"one of the indicator of badness in film is the hype being remembered more than film itself. 
 such was the case with boxing helena, 1993 directorial debut of jennifer chambers lynch, daughter of the great david lynch. 
 made in the dying years of post- twin peaks lynch craze among movie snobs, it was hyped as another,"" warped, twisted masterpiece"" of lynch clan. 
 kim basinger also provided extra publicity by quitting the lead role and being sued for the breech of contract. 
 but, the result was extremely disappointing film, which quickly sank into well- deserved oblivion. 
 the movie protagonist is nick cavanaugh( played by julian sands), talented surgeon who is getting obsessed by helena( sherilyn fenn), beautiful woman who ditched him after brief affair. 
 cavanaugh stalks her and uses every opportunity for the pathetic attempts to re- establish the relationship. 
 during one of such occasions, helena is hit by a car, and nick quickly takes the role of her personal physician in order to have his way with her. after she wakes up, helena discovers not only that she is prisoner in cavanaugh 's stylish residence, but also that cavanaugh amputated her legs in order to prevent her from escaping. 
 she is still trying to escape, so cavanaugh takes off her arms. 
 apart from casting sherilyn fenn( audrey horne in twin peaks and small cameo in wild at heart) and the use of twisted characters and their perverse fantasies, this film by ms. 
 lynch has n't got anything in common with the works of director 's more talented father. 
 despite rather bizarre subject, the style of this film is conventional and setting is light, characters are beautiful- but 
 the result at the end is quite sterile and the film in the end looks too artificial for dark sexual fantasy it was supposed to portray. 
 jennifer lynch obviously lacks talents in directing and it becomes painfully obvious in the scenes that are supposed to erotic- its banal artificiality is even bellow the standards of playboy videos. 
 the actors are n't good either. 
 julian sands is terribly miscast as emotionally disturbed man- this actors is best either when he plays charismatic protagonists or villains; being neurotic does n't suit him. 
 bill paxton was better for this role, but his presence was wasted in forgettable and unnecessary subplot dealing with helena 's boyfriend. 
 sherilyn fenn contributed to this film mostly by her looks, but even the her greater effort in acting could n't help this film. 
 the screenplay, on the other hand, is awful, at least for someone who had made",negative,"The sentiment is negative because the reviewer found the film to be disappointing and forgettable. They criticized the performances, the direction, and the screenplay. They also found the film to be too artificial and sterile, and the erotic scenes to be banal and poorly executed."
"capsule: annoyingly unentertaining, obvious and paper- thin buddy/ cop/ drug/ sexy- witness movie. 
 presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock. 
 i 've seen this movie already, i said, as i looked at the box art. 
 no, i have n't even seen a trailer for the movie; i do n't even know what it 's about, but i can look at the way they 're promoting it, and i know i 've seen it already. 
 i thought: it 's about these two cops. 
 and they 're buddies, sort of. 
 they 're at each other 's throats a lot, but they really do like each other. 
 and everyone else in their department hates them 'cause they 're hot- shots. 
 and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship. 
 and one day they 're in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying. 
 and the bad guy is a drug lord. 
 and there 's a witness, and she 's this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way. 
 and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down. 
 i only missed the bit about the badges. 
 the rest i got dead- on. 
 and i had n't even left the video store yet. 
 the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence, and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo. 
 smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money; martin l. 
 is a family man( shades of the now- tired lethal weapon dynamic here) whose wife and he are at total odds. 
 this leads to some strained scenes about lawrence 's"" not getting any"", and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house, thinking his partner is now his wife 's"" back door man"". 
 not funny; tiresome.

"when i ponder childhood memories past, one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the"" inspector gadget"" tv show with my older brother. 
 truth be told, we were rabid fanatics; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune, alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr. 
 claw, the inspector 's arch nemesis. 
 i was never a biggie on nostalgia, but you just ca n't help but have fond memories of something like that. 
 sometimes i even find myself up at 4 am watching re- runs of my favorite episodes, trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid. 
 at the very least, i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me. 
 despite how horrid a film may be, the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up. 
 so back i sat, with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver( let 's face it; exactly how good can a live- action disney film really be?). 
 i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr. 
 magoo and george of the jungle( two previous disney adaptations), 
 and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well 
. 
 rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness. 
 as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind, i was left sitting there, absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen 
. 
 can something this awful 
 truly exist in such an evolved world? 
 right from the beginning, i knew i was in trouble. 
 in the opening scenes, each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be, to simply serve as real- life duplicates of their cartoon clones. 
 when referring to them, people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be("" oh, hi penny! 
 is brain with you?""). creating one- dimensional replicas is one thing; having mere names take the place of them is quite another.

"1992 's alien3 marked not only the death( by suicide) of its popular protagonist, ellen ripley( sigourney weaver), but, in many ways, the alien franchise itself -- box office receipts were anemic, thanks to poor audience word of mouth; and the critics who rallied around the first two installments, 1979 's alien and 1986 's aliens, savaged david fincher 's slog of a sendoff( myself included). 
 hence, weaver, director jean- pierre jeunet, and the others behind alien resurrection faced a two- fold challenge -- not only somehow resurrect ripley, but also rescue this once- profitable series from the scrap heap. 
 despite the odds, they have succeeded, even if the entertaining new installment does not measure up to the excellent first two. 
 writer joss whedon devises 
 a quick, easy, and painless answer to the dead ripley problem -- clone her, which is what shady military scientists do using some blood left behind on fiorina 161, the prison planet of the third film. 
 that done, the_ real_ challenge presents itself -- what do with her. 
 alien introduced ripley as smart and resourceful 
; aliens simultaneously toughened her up and made her more vulnerable, exploring her maternal side; alien3 saw her undergoing the seven stages of death. 
 what could be next? 
 whedon comes up with a clever spin: since the original ripley died while impregnated with an alien queen, the blood used for the clone is also"" infected"" with alien dna. 
 so the new ripley is, indeed, new -- a human/ alien hybrid blessed with heightened instincts and strength, 
 a psychic bond with the deadly species, and a more predatory attitude. 
 unfortunately, that is where alien resurrection 's clever streak in writing stops. 
 the alien series is known for having stronger stories than most creature features. 
 but the story in resurrection is more of an afterthought. 
 the movie begins with a plot involving some military types attempting to train aliens to do their bidding, but once the creatures break free, it is once again ripley and a ragtag crew( 
 this time a bunch of interstellar smugglers, including tough waif call, played by a game winona ryder) trying to exterminate them. 
 and the alien ripley scenario is ultimately not exploited to its full potential; i would have liked deeper exploration into the quandary of becoming one of the species she has spent her entire life trying to destroy. 
 while the settling into tried- and- true formula is a little disconcerting, 
 the formula is tried- and- true for",positive,"The sentiment is positive because, despite some criticisms, the reviewer acknowledges the film's success in resurrecting the franchise and the protagonist. They appreciate the clever spin on the protagonist's character and the tried-and-true formula, even though they find the story to be an afterthought."
"it rocks- actually, lots of rocks fly at us or from us, in slow or fast motion, at several points in the film. 
 they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward, and when they land- once in a while, when we need a break from the space sequences- they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like. 
( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur.) 
 they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon, a steroid user 's answer to deep impact. 
 bruce willis stars as harry stamper, a famed oil- driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond"" zero barrier"" and destroys our planet. 
 why an oil driller? 
 they require someone experience with deep- core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid. 
( in one unintentionally(?) hilarious sequence, nasa asks harry to inspect a deep- core driller they built based on his blueprints; it is poorly constructed- harry criticizes almost every aspect of it. 
 we trust nasa to build space shuttles?) 
 harry assembles the obligatory"" ragtag"" bunch of"" cowboys"", including a blond guy, a fat guy, a black guy, a wiseass, and the man who is sleeping with his daughter( affleck). 
 once they reach space, we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong- 
 perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it; i can not count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes. 
 whether or not they save the day, i will not reveal. 
 nor will you care. 
 i will say this: you know you 're in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope. 
 willis has barely a chance to come alive; ditto for affleck. 
 their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act, in a last minute- and futile- attempt to inject warmth into the material. 
 steve buscemi 's character- the wiseass- is exceptionally problematic. 
"" rockhound"", as he 's called, is sarcastic and foolish, so they tape him to a chair, where he spends most of the film. 
 so why did they bring him up there to begin with? 
 rather, why write him into the film?

 his tale opens in 1791 louisiana, just south of new orleans, where louis falls victim to the vampire lestat( tom cruise). 
 given a choice between death and eternal life as one of the undead, louis chooses the latter, a decision he will forever regret. 
 everlasting life and eternal youth, promised to him by lestat, turn instead into never ending suffering, damned to eternal hunger for blood and longing for peace. 
 louis can not kill with the impunity of lestat, but, to sate his hunger, he must feed, and the blood of animals is not enough.

 what morris manages is something akin to an intellectual magic trick, an interrogative sleight of hand.

 kiss of the dragon, jet li 's second consecutive american misfire, plays like one big miscalculation, and fails even as the most rudimentary entertainment. 
 now before i start getting e- mails angrily touting the genius of jet li, let me explain myself. 
 li is as spectacular as ever here, and i do n't think anyone would ever dare call his martial- arts- star skills into question. 
 the problem is n't with him, it 's with the movie 's tone. 
 the much touted fight- scenes here are filmed with such unflinching, unrelenting brutality that they are unpleasant to watch.

"here 's something to chew on: what 's the favorite food of big, cheesy- looking special effects monsters 
 like the one lurking in the bowels of a luxury liner in deep rising? 
 the obvious answer to this question is cardboard, because that 's the depth of the most fully- developed character in this painfully generic creature feature. 
 deep rising demonstrates all the originality and vitality of something scripted by a computer. 
 in fact, considering the rigid adherence to the expected formulas, perhaps it was. 
 the most astonishing thing about deep rising is the exceptionally high level of gore. 
 not since starship troopers have this many chunks of flesh( both human and non- human) been scattered in all directions. 
 we learn some bloody trivia, as well, such as how a sea monster spraypaints in red( it drinks a human being then spits out the liquefied remains) and what it does with half- digested leftovers. 
 i suppose deep rising 's gallery of grotesque images represents fun stuff for those who love the macabre, but it does n't do much for me. 
 on the surface, and that 's about the only level at which this film can be analyzed, deep rising feels like tremors grafted onto titanic( everyone else is citing the equally valid aliens/ titanic connection, since james cameron directed both). 
 in going for the big disaster angle of titanic and the tongue- in- cheek mayhem of tremors, deep rising somehow misses both marks by a wide margin. 
 the film is not humorous, tense, or exciting.

 maybe it is better to ignore it, as this strong and biting satire, as only juzo itami can deliver, will give you an insight as to what some foods go through. having, in the past, made films that pulled every punch imaginable, from the family traditions( the funeral), to taxes( a taxing woman& a taxing woman returns), to the diabolical gangsters( minbo), to hospitals( the seriously ill), juzo itami, this time takes on the supermarkets' own war, to get the consumers. and while this film has its funny side, in the crazy situations that it creates, it also shows another side, which is very much the attitude of a corporate structure that is more concerned with its profits than it is with any customer. 
 goro has a supermarket. 
 and a competitor comes into the neighborhood, trying to take him out of business by providing less expensive prices for everything that is sold in the supermarket. 
 bargains galore, its name, has in mind the closure of goro 's humbler venue, so that in the end it can mark up its prices in any way it can.

 a contemporary take on this decidedly' 70s show does n't exactly seem unwarranted, but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf did n't transform into a full- blown case of botulism. 
 how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad, insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time. 
 they are julie, pete and linc, reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd( exposition put out of the way so fast that you 're likely to be lost from the opening moments on), and they are respectively played by claire danes, giovanni ribisi and omar epps, talented actors each deserving of better than this. 
 their plight involves standard cop- corruption stuff, as our would- be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover- up after their superior( reliable dennis farina, one of the best things here and gone so quickly) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking. 
 they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others.

"scarface, a remake of the 1932 film of the same name, is a very gripping and, as far as i know, a true- to- life story of how power and violence lead to corruption. 
 al pacino, as tony montana( for whom the movie is named), also provides a brilliant performance as a cuban refugee who comes to america with less than nothing and becomes one of the most highly respected and feared drug lords in miami. 
 oliver stone also penned the screenplay in one of his earlier writing roles. 
 the film begins by disclosing the story of now fidel castro ordered thousands of cubans to set sail and head for the coasts of the united states. 
 many of these cubans had criminal records, such as tony montana, a cocky, fast- talking man who has the look of crime. 
 nearly right after his arrival in miami, tony is thrust into the gangster life when he participates in a cocaine buy that goes awry. 
 along with his friend and partner, manolo( steven bauer), tony rises in the gangster ranks when he forms a friendship with frank lopez( robert loggia), a high- roller in the organized crime field. 
 tony also begins to fall in love with elvira( michelle pfeiffer), who at the time was frank 's lover. 
 of course, sooner or later in this industry, betrayal and corruption amount into a force greater than anything else, and tony is one of the ones who fall victim to this force. 
 this is not before he becomes one of the most respected, and often feared, men in miami. 
 tony gets to the point where he can not trust anyone, and everyone he knows basically feels the same way towards him. 
 no one can trust him, and basically, no one does. 
 scarface, although incredibly violent, is one of the best crime films of its time and stands out as another great performance for al pacino. 
 although he did not receive any recognition from the academy for his performance, it truly is a very good one. 
 in fact, his accent and facial movements alone are enough in my mind to win at least a nomination( although he did get a golden globe nomination). 
 another element that stands out when someone mentions this film is the profanity. 
 a figure tagged to the film boasts that the word"" fuck"" and it 's uses are uttered 206 times throughout the film, which is apparently a record. 
 the thing is, the vulgarity fits rather well with the movie. 
 as odd as",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the movie ""Scarface"" for its gripping and true-to-life story, brilliant performance by Al Pacino, and the screenplay by Oliver Stone.

"for better or worse, the appearance of basic instinct in the movie marketplace gave the greenlight to a whole slew of overheated, oversexed, underwritten thrillers. 
 apparently not having joe eszterhas as the writer does n't change a thing, since body of evidence was n't written by him, but has a puzzling eszterhas- ish presence all over it. 
 in other words, it 's a) really dirty and b) 
 really, really stupid. 
 madonna( first warning sign) stars in body of evidence as a woman who has piles of money and no apparent job 
; she lives on a houseboat and likes to parade around semi- naked, presumably for the edification of the shrimp. 
 she 's been accused of having murdered an older man who was her lover. 
 already two classic examples of hollywood sexism are in effect -- the first being that any woman in a movie can not be sexual unless she 's under thirty( or at least looks it), and that they usually only exist for the sake of studs or filthy rich older men. 
 what 's worse is that the movie confirms all the above, and wallows in them as well. 
 madonna 's character is accused of forcing sex on the old goat when she knew darned well he had a heart condition. 
( and yes, there are the obligatory cracks from the cops about how at least he died happy. 
 this movie leave no scummy stone unturned.) 
 anyway. 
 willem dafoe( very good but completely wasted) also stars as the lawyer who is doomed to run afoul of madonna 's sexuality.

 because his character is set up with the token wife and kids. 
 how obvious is it that he 's gon na cheat on her and have to fess everything up? 
 and get kicked out of the house? 
 and get welcomed back anyway? 
 do n't skip to the end yet 
; we 're just getting warmed up. 
 dafoe and madonna have a lot of sex in this movie. 
 most of it is about as erotic as open- heart surgery, since it involves such goodies as hot candlewax( always the kink of choice among screenwriters who do n't know the first thing about* really* kinky sex) and smashed light bulbs. 
 do n't ask.

"full metal jacket, very much like every other hard- hitting film about the vietnam war, is an shocking, emotional depiction of the war that effected almost everyone in america. 
 this film is more like platoon than any other in the way that it chronicles the struggles of a young man( private joker, played by matthew modine) during his tour in the vietnam war. 
 however, full metal jacket gives the audience an insight into combat life very rarely seen before: boot camp. 
 these sequences are considered to be the best part in this three act film, even though i found the later portions to be equally stunning. 
 as in platoon, full metal jacket gets off to a quick start. 
 the opening sequence is the initiation for the recruits, which is getting their heads shaved. 
 from there, they find themselves standing at attention and receiving their orders from the extremely hard and punishing sergeant hartman, played extremely well by the former drill instructor r. 
 lee ermey. 
 apparently, the solution was found for the perfect man to play a drill instructor in the movies, because ermey depicts his character extremely well and will make you thank whomever that you were never subjected to such horrible situations. 
 private joker gets off on the wrong foot with the sergeant, as does the large bodied private leonard lawrence( vincent d'onofrio), whom is dubbed' gomer pyle' by sgt. hartman. 
 the film is continually narrated by private joker, in which he explains his visions on what is going on. 
 the entire corps, although repeatedly hammered by sgt. 
 hartman, continues on. 
 private pyle, however, seems to be the rag doll for the drill instructor. 
 he continually absorbs the worst punishment and humiliation, and it basically does not stop. 
 that is, until sgt. 
 hartman comes up with a new plan. 
 he will punish the rest of the soon- to- be- marines for pyle 's goof- ups, even after joker was assigned to help him out in the best way he can. 
 pyle then receives punishment from his fellow recruits, and things take a turn for the worst. 
 pyle proves that not everyone is emotionally, physically, and mentally cut out for the life of a marine. 
 after graduation, joker is sent over to the height of the action in order to document the war, which is his service. 
 he is not a member of the infantry, and it is unclear if he will ever actually find himself in combat. 
 when he sets out on a documenting",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the movie ""Full Metal Jacket"" for its shocking and emotional depiction of the Vietnam War. The reviewer praises the film for its unique insight into combat life, particularly boot camp, and the performances of the actors, especially R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor."
"i was pleasantly surprised by this film. 
 with a budget topping$ 200 million, i was quite skeptical about whether throwing all that money toward one of the twentieth century 's greatest tragedies would make a film exciting enough to see. 
 how much could you dress up the sets? 
 how many models and computer effects could you use? how much more action could you pack into a ship that sinks? 
 oh, if i 've just given away part of the plot for you, go back to school. 
 after having viewed titanic, however, i found it to be a well- paced, well- designed, and overall well- made movie. 
 there have been many films made about the maiden and final voyage of the ocean liner titanic, but this latest offering from director james cameron is the best i 've seen. 
 titanic tells its story in two time periods. 
 it starts out in the present, when ocean explorer brock lovett( bill paxton) and his team are exploring the wreckage of the titanic on the floor of the atlantic, searching for a priceless diamond necklace which supposedly went down with the ship. 
 what they find instead is a drawing of a woman wearing the necklace, which is broadcast on the news. 
 the woman in the picture recognizes herself and phones lovett, who has her flown out to his exploration vessel on the high seas. 
 there she tells her story to lovett and his team. 
 in 1912, rose dewitt bukater( kate winslett), a young lady belonging to society 's upper class, boards the titanic for the ship 's first atlantic crossing, from southampton, england to new york. 
 she is engaged to cal hockley( billy zane), an heir to old money, and a snob in every sense of the word. 
 on board, rose feels the stifling trappings of high- society 's expectations, and resolves to escape from it all by throwing herself off the titanic 's stern, but is saved from her self- proclaimed fate by jack dawson( leonardo dicaprio), a passenger in third- class("" steerage"", as it 's referred to), who talks her out of jumping. 
 although for rose the attraction is not immediate, a love affair soon develops between the two, which endangers rose 's social standing as well as her engagement to the jealous cal. 
 the story sounds very simple, and perhaps even unexciting, but through solid performances by the leads and good direction by cameron, a good movie comes through. 
 dicaprio is marvelous as the young, but worldly",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer commends the movie ""Titanic"" for being well-paced, well-designed, and well-made. The reviewer appreciates the film's storytelling in two time periods, the performances of the lead actors, and the direction by James Cameron. They also express surprise and satisfaction with how the large budget was effectively used in the movie."
"capsule: 
 the much anticipated re- adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting, but very little intelligence. 
 visually there is much to like about this version, but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver 's travels and treat it as an action film. 
 that makes it a film without much center., 0( -4 to +4) 
 pierre boulle, author of the bridge on the river kwai, wrote planet of the apes( a. k. a. monkey planet), the novel, as a social satire. 
 it reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver 's travels. 
 humans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed, not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift 's island of the houyhnhnms. 
 the novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet. 
 it seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals, but perhaps i was just looking for that. 
 when rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968, he added a number of serling touches, familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling- ish. 
 the final irony of the original version has become film history. 
 without it there could never have been a"" planet of the apes"" film series. 
 i can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language. 
 in the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language. 
 that could have been done in the film, but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non- ape- speaking. 
 serling avoided this by having the apes speak english and, of course, there is some justification for that by the end of the film. 
 justifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending. 
 but serling never tackles the all- important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language, a language they had no opportunity to ever hear. 
 few viewers questioned this serious plot hole, however, and the film has become well respected in cinema history. 
 partial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith 's best if not",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the film for its lack of intelligence, serious plot holes, and the approach of treating it as an action film rather than a social satire as in the original novel.

 but there 's temptation awaiting both of them 
 -- johnny 's is in the form of an old friend( dina meyer) also in the infantry and still harboring a secret crush, while carmen attracts the eye of her flirtatious instructor( patrick muldoon).

"8 mm is not going to enlighten your day. 
 it 's a dark, grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence. 
 not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess, you 'll require a lot of patience as well. 
 nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late. 
 he wore a bizarre get- up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes, and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality. 
 cage plays private investigator tom welles, praised for his secrecy and reliability. 
 at home, welles is a family man, with a wife( catherine keener) and a small daughter to take care of. 
 his new assignment is a bizarre one: the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husband 's safe. 
 the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man, until the girl is brutally murdered. 
 or so it seems. 
 welles, of course, begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth. 
 and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case, the more he gets in over his head. 
 he hires an adult book store clerk named max california( joaquin phoenix) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography. 
 max knows what welles is getting himself into, and explains,` you dance with the devil, the devil do n't change. 
 the devil changes you.'

"plunkett& macleane is a period piece mired down by modern mtv pretentions. 
 i have nothing against the mtv approach to filmmaking -- used properly it can save a movie( see stigmata) -- but 
 it ruins this one, making a muddled, incoherent mess out of a potentially interesting premise. 
 there are certain genres that just do n't go together. 
 the film opens with a sequence that i still do n't understand. 
 it involves some sort of prison outbreak, a robbery, and a gem that keeps being eaten. 
 in any case, the caper( whatever it may be) brings together plunkett and macleane( robert carlyle and johnny lee miller, respectively), two happy- go- lucky brits with no way to make a living. 
 they make a pact to steal money from the rich and give it to themselves until they earn enough money to buy a ticket to america. 
 their first heist involves a young debutante named lady rebecca( liv tyler); a woman macleane was especially friendly with at a party just earlier.

 none of his skill in actually moving the camera.

 the camerawork is even more nauseating 
 than in the purposefully dizzying the blair witch project due to its lack of fluidity. 
 instead of utilizing panning shots to impress upon us the scope of the events scott uses attention- deficit- disorder edits.

"jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation. 
 even though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited, the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation. 
 this is, after all, the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction. 
 to say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood, since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio, desperado, four rooms, and from dusk' til dawn. 
 he was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide. 
( i 'm willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him.) 
 tarantino contributed on and off screen to these films, but never took the director 's helm. 
 nearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more, tarantino returns with a film he can call his own. 
 the film opens up with an homage to the graduate, with jackie brown( pam grier) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her. 
 jackie is a flight attendant for air cabo, which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas.

 for ordell, jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus( michael bowen) and atf agent ray nicolet( michael keaton), who catch her not only with the money, but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs. 
 jackie did n't know they were in the package with the cash, but that 's of no consequence to the authorities, who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted. 
 of course, dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish, ordell. 
 ordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry( robert forster) to get jackie out of jail, but while max is immediately attracted to her, jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety, since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police.

 jim jarmusch writer: jim jarmusch rating: good shot( stars) languid, yet pointed and focused, ghost dog: 
 the way of the samurai sublimely savages our cultural fascination with the mafia and the sleek, ultra- cool, cinematic image of the hitman. 
 juxtaposing the samurai 's honor code of feudal japan against the tradition bound modus operandi of the american/ italian mafia, it ceaselessly chips away with a sculptor 's precision at the archaic foundations of both as they lumber, dinosaur- like, to function in the modern era. 
 director jarmusch gleefully plays the iconoclast, ripping into mafioso precepts with splashes of acidic wit. 
 using a palate of bleached colors, jarmusch lugubriously maintains a tone of desolation that belies the many sparks of laugh out loud humor punctuating the film. 
 he does n't cater to audience expectations of hyper- colorized, stylized violence and gunplay where no one dies. 
 the action is presented in flat, brutal codas. 
 bullets have permanence. 
 death has consequences. 
 the movie rises beyond standard conventions to become a meditation on the concepts of honor and loyalty. 
 it is an anti- movie, of sorts. 
 there are few photogenic, empathetic characters for the audience to fall in love with. 
 this is n't a film that lovingly holds your hand. 
 there are dark, contemplative moments and the film firmly holds you by the shoulder, just so, asserting itself for all to see.

"yeah, 
 yeah, the advertisements did n't even try to conceal the fact that this movie had only one hook- sex. 
 neve campbell and starship trooper 's denise richards getting it on? 
 ok! 
 yeah, 
 it 's a decent two minutes of film erotica, but even if that 's your main interest in this film, 
 there 's plenty of cheeziness to sit thru in exchange for those two minutes. 
 wild things does have a lot more to think about than you might expect however. 
 nearly every single scene is a huge plot twist guaranteed to leave you guessing, or at least curious to see the next turn, throughout the entire movie. 
 but this fast- paced, razor- sharp turning of events does n't leave much time to enjoy the surprises. 
 we start off in a high- class california high school where every student resembles a supermodel in the making. 
 guidance counselor sam lombardo( matt dillon) seems to catch the eye of every student, particularly kelly van ryan( richards), daughter of the locally prestigious family whose social status is about as high as their bank accounts. 
 right off the bat, kelly is using every asset she has in an effort to seduce"" mr. lombardo"". 
 the fund- raiser car wash seems the opportune time, particularly when you wash your guidance counselor 's jeep in all white clothes and take plenty of precautions to insure you 'll be soaked from head to toe when you 're done. 
 on the weekend of the car wash, kelly 's attempts at seduction fall flat, and when they do, she concocts the tale that sam in fact raped her that day. 
 naturally sam is thrown into a state of panicked shock at these accusations. 
 but the otherwise unsubstantial fabrications soon lead to a criminal trial when a low- class, marijuana smoking student by the name of suzie toller( campbell) comes forth with a near identical story, also involving her trusted guidance counselor. 
 pitting himself against the communities most respected names and authoritarians, sam must prove his innocence thru the aid of his makeshift defense attorney, ken bowden, played by bill murray. 
 yes, that bill murray! 
 sound like a good, complete movie? 
 yes, that alone could have been, but this is just the beginning. 
 in fact, the trial is over about fifteen or twenty minutes into the film. 
 it is merely used to launch the most twisted story of recent time. 
 by the time the movie finishes, you will have gone thru every plot twist imaginable.",negative,The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for its excessive focus on sexual content and its lack of substance. The reviewer also mentions that the plot twists are too fast-paced and do not leave much time for the audience to enjoy the surprises.
"i have to admit that i disliked this film initially. 
 it certianly is n't for every taste, and it 's sheer torture to sit through if you 're in a restless mood. 
 that said, if you are in the right mood, it 's absolutely incredible 
. 
 this was my second favorite movie of 1998, and would have been a shoo- in for first 
 in almost any other year. 
 perhaps the big turn- off for many was this film 's unconventionality. 
 i 'd be hard- pressed to compare it to any other film that i 've seen- it is very, very artsy, incredibly slow- and amazingly, it works beautifully. 
 on my second viewing, i realized that the film follows the three act structure( i did n't think it had any sort of structure at all when i first saw it). 
 the first act serves to set up the characters- sort of. 
 it exists even moreso to set a mood of tension and restlesness, and perhaps even feelings of boredom. 
 and then it is shattered by the intense violence of the second( which encompasses most of the movie). 
 the majority of the film is one extended battle scene, intercut with brief flashbacks and voice- overs. 
 the artsier elements do not detract from the action, but add to it- they succeed in briefly letting the viewer peek into the minds of the soldiers, only to be suddenly yanked back into reality when the battle resumes. 
 the battle scenes are amazing 
( second only to"" saving private ryan"" in my opinion). 
 they 're brutal, horrifying, and at times beautiful due to the amazing cinematography. 
 the second act is as immersive, brilliant, and haunting as any film that i have ever seen. 
 the only problems come during the first and third acts. 
 malick takes a little too long to get the film started. 
 although the initial scenes- which consist of two soldiers' experiencing a near- eden- like paradise while going awol, and the preperations for battle- are effective and necessary, hints of pretentiousness sink in. 
 the film is just a tad too artsy near the beginning, and a lot of people that disliked the movie probably gave up on it because of this. 
 the final act is effective at winding the film down, but the problems from the first persist- it 's a bit too long, and comes over as pretentious at times. 
 that said, there are two sequences( one where a soldier gets a devastating note from his",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer appreciates the unconventional narrative and the intense battle scenes of the movie.

"the dream team is a thoroughly entertaining comedy featuring four loveable characters who just happen to be slightly insane. 
 billy, played by michael keaton, is an extremely temperamental mental ward patient whose short fuse and violent tantrums tend to get him in trouble. 
 christopher lloyd portrays henry, an obsessive- compulsive who requires that everything be neat, orderly, on schedule, and by the books. 
 he thinks he 's a doctor 
 so he walks around wearing a suit and carrying a clipboard on which he constantly scribbles notes and files reports. 
 jack, played by peter boyle, thinks he 's jesus. 
 and finally, there 's stephen furst as albert, 
 a chubby catatonic who speaks only in baseball and television phrases. 
 the dream team follows the misadventures that beset the four- some when their psychiatrist, dr. 
 weitzman, takes them out of the hospital for a field trip to yankee stadium. 
 during a pit stop, they get separated from weitzman and are left to fend for themselves in manhattan. 
 the movie 's charm derives mostly from the camaraderie and chemistry between its delightful cast. 
 the four leads in the film play off each other quite effectively; they never miss an opportunity to argue, bicker, or insult one another. 
 henry and jack, for example, fight over who 's going to get to ride in the front passenger seat on the way to the game. 
 the actors in the dream team have a lot of fun with their characters and with each other. 
 michael keaton is 
 well cast 
 as billy; he gives his cynical character considerable complexity. 
 as the divinely jack, peter boyle succeeds in keeping his one- dimensional character funny and fresh. 
 although stephen furst 's catatonic character is cliched, the actor makes him sympathetic and endearing. 
 while keaton, boyle, and furst are good, it 's christopher lloyd who really makes the movie special. 
 lloyd gives yet another outstanding comic performance. 
 his body language( for example, the way he walks) and his facial expressions are perfectly suited to his compulsive character. 
 lloyd 's brilliant performance yields a pathetic, moving, and memorable character. 
 the dream team is a solid comedy with more depth and drama than you might expect from its simple premise. 
 the characters are so appealing that you can excuse the film for its often outlandish and unbelievable plot.

" 
 what is this, a homicide or a bad b- movie? 
"" 
 that is the prophetic question asked by one of the leads in one of the early scenes of this movie. 
 let me clear things up for you cupcake, 
 this is n't a bad b- movie, it 's a really bad b- movie. 
 so bad, it 's almost good. 
 almost, but not quite. 
 the movie starts off in the 1950 's with space aliens sending a botched experiment down to earth. 
 it is a bunch of slug- like creatures that kill people and take over their bodies. 
 the slugs' first and only victim in the fifties is cryogenically frozen where he is of no danger to anybody. 
 that is, until two loser university students unfreeze him in 1986. 
 he, and the slugs inside him, promptly begin wreaking havoc and turning more co- eds into slug zombies. 
 a slightly crazed cop( tom atkins) and the requisite girl with the face of an angel( jill whitlow) join these two geeky university students( jason lively and steve marshall) to do battle with the slugs. 
 it more or less falls on the four of them to make the world safe again from the evil slugs. 
 the acting is bad with a capital b. 
 the story is worse. 
 and the special effects are somewhere between an old rerun of star trek and what you see in a home movie. 
 the only saving grace was the requisite tit- shot courtesy of jill whitlow. 
 it had absolutely nothing to do with the story -- but i liked it. 
 actually, it was the high point of the movie for me. 
 of course, that is n't really saying much. 
 the story moves around in a hap hazard fashion. 
 which gives it a leg up on some other horror films. 
 unlike most movies of this genre, there actually is a story. 
 not a great one, but it is there. 
 this is one in a long line of movies from the 1980 's that were thrown together to capitalize off the success of the friday the 13th, halloween and nightmare on elm street movies. 
 you could randomly select a movie out of the horror section of you local video store and probably luck into something just as good if not better. 
 but night of the creeps might make a nice addition to a b- movie horror marathon. 
 just do n't be too upset if you ca n't find it. 
 you really wo n't be missing that",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for being a really bad B-movie. The reviewer also criticizes the acting, story, and special effects, and only mentions one positive aspect, which is unrelated to the story."
"the great actor james woods once said( and i 'm paraphrasing),"" if sex is n't messy, then you 're not doing it right"". a truly profound statement, and one that could be made for the entire mad slasher genre( just replace"" sex"" with"" your mad slasher film""). 
 for those uninformed souls, the mad slasher genre( or sub- genre) is a melding of horror and exploitation elements put to the service of a plot that follows an identical outline: a usually masked but always crazed killer stalks and kills attractive teens a la halloween. 
 urban legend is a mad slasher flick, but one that is so sanitary, bloodless, and nudity free, that with its irony laden dialogue and beautiful( though not overly talented) cast, it more closely resembles an overlong wb television special. 
 for film makers, gore is one of the two weapons they have at their disposal in a stale, fright- free horror movie, as stephen king once said( again paraphrasing)"" if you ca n't scare your audience, gross em' out, if you ca n't do that, make em' laugh"". 
 alas, urban legend succeeds only at the latter, though not by intention. 
 i actually find the fact that this film became a minor success($ 40 million domestic box office gross) more frightening than anything in it. 
 it seems that audiences' tastes have been whittled down to such a degree that any movie even claiming to be scary is given the benefit of the doubt. 
 the promotion for urban legend sure promised thrills, but 
 how can anyone with a three digit iq argue that it provides them. 
 unfortunately, these kinds of flicks will continue to be produced because people no longer have expectations; one idiotic super- hyped blockbuster flick after another has desensitized audiences to the point where films do n't need to do anything more than promise a good time without the added pressure of delivering. 
 if anyone disagrees i would love for them to explain the box office successes of shit like batman and robin, wild wild west, and godzilla. 
 but forget all that, it goes without saying that mad slasher films( or any other exploitation off- shoot) will be made without an ounce of craft( especially considering the sheer volume that are produced). 
 allow me to present you with the real fault of the mad slasher film: 
 the lack of enthusiastic exploitation. 
 these flicks are n't harnessed with any lofty aspirations, so why not break free and give your audience a bloody good",negative,"The review is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie for being sanitary, bloodless, and nudity-free.

"the film"" magnolia"" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests. 
 the dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower. 
 they all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart. 
 the numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially. 
 from a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host, each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain. 
 they are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness. 
 whether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse, each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one. 
"" magnolia"" is a clever, well thought out film from prodigy director- writer paul thomas anderson of"" boogie nights"" fame. 
 the detailed character analyses and the powerful script make"" magnolia"" memorable. 
 however, what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories, the film is never confusing. 
 anderson 's control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful. 
 he also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of"" magnolia 's"" scenes drag on too long. 
 any three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending. 
 from the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just does n't get boring 
. 
 it is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot. 
 this is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation. 
 every character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees. 
 for example, cop john c. 
 reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall 's daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly. 
 the fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes, races, and genders suffer. 
 anderson 's explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing. 
 the only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously. 
 this was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also 
 because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get.

"losing a job is not an all too uncommon thing. 
 reacting to such a personal setback by taking a group of small children hostage is a bit more rare. 
 while we all might feel the desire to blow someone 's head off with a shotgun when they do n't seem to grasp our point of view, actually threatening them with one is usually something we avoid. 
 this is n't the case with sam baily- john travolta 's slightly askew average- joe persona in mad city. 
"" 
 i do n't think people listen to guys like me,"" sam laments during an exclusive interview from behind the walls of a museum. 
 just a few days ago, sam was a guard at this same museum, but when cutbacks led to the elimination of his security position, sam 's apprehension resulted in a brash decision. 
 in an effort to get his ex- boss, museum director mrs. 
 banks( blythe danner), to"" just listen"", he barges into the museum one day equipped with a fully loaded shotgun, taking the uncooperative banks and a group of school children hostage. 
 sam 's overall concern is valid enough- if he loses his job, his paycheck, his benefits, etc., his wife and two children wo n't be provided for. 
 he 's not a lunatic or a hot- tempered madman, he 's somewhat like a child- panicky, compulsive, and running on emotion- and his naive intentions are n't helped any by the fact that banks was n't overly compassionate with the let go. 
 overall, he 's just like you and me- except that he has the capacity to view the line we 'd deem"" far enough"" as the starting mark of some crazy race. 
 meanwhile, television reporter max brackett( dustin hoffman) is also on the scene. 
 covering a"" fluff"" story for the evening news concerning the museum cutbacks, max suddenly finds himself in the middle of the biggest- breaking news story he ever could 've hoped for. having been demoted from network newsman to smalltime affiliate reporting, max is anxious to turn this into his, and only his, story. 
 max immediately bonds with sam. 
 max even coaches sam thru hostage negotiations and writes scripts for him to use with the police over the phone.

 derek is more interested in the ideas of white supremacy than in its culture of violence. 
 at a basketball court, black and white tempers flare. 
 derek channels the aggression into a game, black versus white, for ownership of the courts.

 derek obliges by leading his younger and dumber friends in race- motivated mob crimes. 
 at the bottom of the chain, derek 's younger brother danny( edward furlong, made famous in terminator 2) joins the skinheads not for ideological or intellectual reasons, but because he admires his brother and he wants to belong.

"i suppose an argument could be made that toy story is one of those films that did n't need a sequel. 
 beloved by kids and their parents, respected equally by mainstream america and geekish movie buffs, that first movie remains a landmark of recent history, the one that burst open the possibilities of computer animation and demonstrated through wild invention and giddy chutzpah just how complacent the disney animation machine had become in cranking out fluffy razzle- dazzle entertainment full of formula storytelling and banal songwriting. 
 if disney was embarrassed at being beaten at its own game( toy story was a smash hit of unexpected proportions, and one that caught the merchandising end of the business unaware as demand for action figures far outstripped supply), it did n't show, and as distributor and part- owner of the property, at least it had a piece of the action. 
 toy story 2 was greenlighted as a direct- to- video project, disney 's standard tactic for milking a few more bucks out of hot franchises without expending the effort of developing a proper feature film. 
 as someone who does n't believe sequels are necessarily a bad thing( granted, they usually are a bad thing, but that 's because they 're made for the wrong reasons), i had to wonder what in the world they were thinking. 
 fortunately, disney claimed to have been so knocked- out by early animation tests that they let pixar go full- speed ahead with a theatrical sequel. 
 lucky thing, too -- like the first movie, 
 this one is a joy to behold on the big screen, and technically, it improves on its predecessor on just about every level. 
( from a business standpoint, the end credits show that the new creations are copyrighted by pixar, while the previous film 's elements are shared between pixar and disney, a sign of the production house 's new cachet in hollywood.) 
 visually, the main shortcoming of this fully computer- generated movie is that human figures are still rendered relatively poorly, making them look a little creepy. 
 fortunately, that eerie unreality fits in perfectly with the perspective of the movie, where the secret world of toys is more immediate, and arguably more attractive, than the world of the humans who surround them.

 farquaad agrees to relocate the pests, on the condition that shrek rescues princess fiona( diaz) -- whom farquaad desires to we d -- from a far- off castle. 
 grudgingly, shrek sets out, joined in his quest by an unwanted companion, donkey( murphy). 
 review: 
 one memorable aspect of disney 's"" aladdin"" was that it finally gave robin williams a character -- the genie -- to best take advantage of his comic talents. 
"" shrek"" does the same for eddie murphy; ironically, though, murphy 's ideal vessel turns out to be an ass. 
 all the same,"" shrek"" does represent murphy 's best comic outing in years, and as donkey he steals all the best lines. 
 for instance, after getting belted with pixie dust while trying to conceal his nature as a magical creature, donkey soars into the air and scoffs,"" now i 'm a flying talking donkey!"" and despite its many contributors, the script for"" shrek"" is full of such comic gems. 
 myers is delightful in more of a straight man role, and lithgow also gets some great moments 
( watch for a hilarious repartee with the gingerbread man). 
"" shrek"" takes great pleasure in lampooning fairy tales and nursery rhymes of all sorts, and reserves a few delightful knocks at disney in the bargain 
. 
 things do go somewhat astray during the film 's middle segment, which concentrates too much on the main characters at the expense of some of the terrific fairy tale satire which is the movie 's greatest strength. 
 but even then, one can always sit back and enjoy the beautiful computer animation, whose remarkable use here represents yet another dazzling leap forward for the technology. 
",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises the performances, especially Eddie Murphy's, and the script. They also appreciate the movie's satirical take on fairy tales and its impressive computer animation."
"you 'd think that after awhile hollywood would stop trying to make movies out of video games. 
 it has n't worked so far. 
"" street fighter?"" 
"" super mario brothers? 
"""" wing commander? 
"""" mortal kombat?"" not a watchable film in the bunch. 
 still i held out some hope for"" tomb raider. 
"" 
 after all, the game 's premise is heavily influenced by the indiana jones trilogy and all the mummy movies, so there are cinematic elements imbedded in the concept. 
 however, despite the potential of the project,"" tomb raider"" proves to be yet another bomb. 
 the plot is a convoluted accumulation of nonsense probably borrowed from a dozen bad movies. 
 there 's a once- ever-5000-years alignment of planets coming up, and the illuminati have to find both halves of an ancient triangle that controls time in order to take over the world. 
 of course, the ancient folks who divided the triangle buried the halves in tombs on opposite sides of the world. 
 our heroine, lady lara croft( angelina jolie), finds the key that opens the tombs in relics that her dead father( jon voight) dug up. 
 she figures that if she gets the triangle, she can bring her dad back from the dead. 
 of course, no one was expecting much of a plot from this movie anyway. 
 in both video games and action movies, the plot is just an excuse for the action sequences. 
 however, the action in"" tomb raider"" shows little style or originality. 
 there 's lots of shooting and some kung fu fightin', but none of it progresses beyond the level of a cheap direct- to- cable flick. 
 the other goofy archeologist flick of the summer 
,"" the mummy returns,"" was much better; it had its flaws, but its action was creative and large- scale.

"on re- watching italian writer/ director dario argento 's much lauded murder mystery tenebrae, i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with. 
 in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles, but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his"" giallo"" murder mysteries. 
 while it 's certainly not perfect, repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller. 
 the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal( anthony franciosa) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book"" tenebrae"". 
 with the police on his back for leads, he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems. 
 the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa. 
 he brings grace, charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real- life horror around him. 
 the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension. 
 argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral, ambivalent, shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business. 
 tenebrae is perhaps the most multi- layered of argento 's scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here. 
 it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play. 
 in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/ profondo rosso( the full- length italian language version) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes. 
 needless to say for argento fans, there is no denying the director 's brilliance as a stylist. 
 many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork. 
 they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light, rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria. 
 instead, tenebrae 's set design and lighting paints a sleek, clinical, chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world. 
 and the soundtrack 's mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment. 
 so tenebrae has much to recommend it, no question. 
 still, constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in",positive,"The review is positive because it praises the movie ""Tenebrae"" for its stylish thriller, fine central performance by Franciosa, fascinating psychosexual tension, and intriguing camerawork. The reviewer also appreciates the multi-layered script and the director's brilliance as a stylist."
"getting it right is a far far cry from the teenage sex comedy you might expect from a summer movie about male virginity. 
 the film was directed by randal kleiser, who brought us such bubble- gum classics as grease and the blue lagoon. 
 but thanks to kleiser 's surprisingly good direction and an intelligent script, getting it right is a pleasantly quiet, moving, and memorable film -- one geared strictly toward a sophisticated, adult audience. 
 getting it right 
 stars jesse birdsall( emily lloyd 's boyfriend in wish you were here) as gavin, a painfully shy 31-year- old hairdresser who lives at home with his parents and who -- gasp -- is still a virgin. 
 gavin has no problem whatsoever making small talk with the elderly women who clamor for his services at the hair salon, but expose him to a single 30-year- old beauty 
 and he 's a mess. 
 much to gavin 's surprise, the woman who finally brings him out of his shell and robs him of his virginity is joan( lynn redgrave), a rich, married, and lonely 45-year- old. 
 getting it right is the simple story of gavin 's awkward and haphazard efforts to get it right; that is, to find the right woman to fulfill his life. 
 getting it right is one of those rare movies that devotes itself entirely to in- depth character development. 
 gavin 's self- conscious voice- over narration of his experiences firmly thrusts us into his psyche. 
 we observe his fascinating metamorphosis from shy and passive introversion to assertive and self- confident maturity. 
 birdsall 's superb, understated performance 
 as gavin is the real backbone of the film; he seems convincing and authentic throughout. 
 the charm of getting it right also lies in the wide array of people who inhabit or invade gavin 's life. 
 despite her limited screen time, redgrave makes quite a splash in the movie as gavin 's middle- aged seducer. 
 for a supporting character, joan is unusually and impressively complex, thanks in large part to redgrave 's magnificent performance. 
 gavin is also pursued, or perhaps plagued, by minnie, the totally neurotic daughter of a rich aristocrat. 
 after minnie and gavin meet at a party, she takes great pleasure in disrupting his safe and simple life. 
 helena bonham carter is delightfully pathetic and kooky in the role, and sir john gielgud, with his tongue in his cheek, embodies the height of arrogance as her father. 
 gavin 's eventual love- interest is jenny, the adorable twenty- year- old single mother who assists him",positive,"The review is positive because it appreciates the movie ""Getting it Right"" for its good direction, intelligent script, in-depth character development, and superb performance by Birdsall. The reviewer also praises the complex supporting characters and the performances of the actors."
"the rich man 's wife is one of those movies like final analysis or body double, where the story and characters are so one- dimensional and contrived that you know you should n't be enjoying yourself. 
 but somehow, the movie just tries so hard that you begin to forgive it and get into the swing of things. 
 not that it 's bad, it 's just that it 's been done before; and better, in my opinion. 
 i realize that this is going to sound pretty bizarre, but it 's probably the best analogy that i can come up with right now; you know how when you see a spider or something in your toilet, striving helplessly to get out, and instead of just flushing him, 
 you end up kind of rooting for the little guy? 
 that 's basically how i felt about this movie. 
 i mean, it 's not very good, but it 's not completely bad either. 
 the wife of the title is josie potenza( played nicely by halle berry). 
 she is married to tony( christopher mcdonald... 
 you know, the guy who looks like joe piscapo), a really stressed- out businessman who drinks way to much and does n't give josie the attention she deserves(* cough, cough*). 
 thus, she is driven into the arms of another man, jake golden( clive owen). 
 near the beginning of the film, josie decides to try and work things out with tony by dumping jake and going on a vacation to a remote cabin in the woods. 
 once there, however, tony has to leave almost immediately due to business details( i 'm still not quite sure what line of work he 's in). 
 making the best of her situation, josie stays there and begins making the rounds at the local bars. 
 one night, she meets a stranger named cole( peter greene, finally getting a meaty role). 
 they have dinner together, and eventually, both josie and the audience start to realize that cole is homicidal. 
 after learning that she is not happily married, cole offers to"" take care"" of the problem. 
 managing to escape from the psychotic maniac, josie returns home and starts a reconciliation with her estranged and very wealthy husband. 
 but then one night, cole shows up.

"note: some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers. be forewarned. 
 on december 20, 1996, amidst all the year- end oscar bait releases from the major studios, miramax 's genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream. 
 although the teen horror market had been given up for all- but- dead in recent years, the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns, eventually topping$ 100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history, while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre. 
 the sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly, everybody was looking for hip, inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes. 
 the strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost. 
 scream director wes craven, previously best known as the creator of new line 's a nightmare on elm street film series, was thrust back into the limelight. 
 and scream 's rookie scribe, kevin williamson, burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion. 
 it 's hard to understate this last point. 
 mr. 
 williamson has, based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing( scream, i know what you did last summer from october 1997, and now scream 2), enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame, quickly become the most well- known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly- reading, box office figure- watching youth culture since -- well, since that quentin tarantino guy( whom, it is said, has also achieved some renown as a director). 
 indeed, in a singularly freakish oddity, it is the screenwriter, mr. williamson, and not the director that has been receiving the lion 's share of acclaim for the success of scream, and the print advertisements for scream 2 's theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence: while the traditional"" a film by wes craven"" drapes the film 's title in the ads, right below it( in equal sized font, yet) reads"" written by kevin williamson"", an affirmation of the screenwriter 's contribution to the project which may be unprecedented. 
( i can envision the board of wga, licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of"" a film by"" is attained.) 
 and, much like mr. 
 tarantino 's screenwriting, mr. 
 williamson 's work is vaguely unconventional,",positive,"The review is positive because it praises the movie ""Scream 2"" for its success and the contributions of the screenwriter, Kevin Williamson. The reviewer also appreciates the casting strategy and the unconventional writing style of Williamson."
"the most common( and in many cases the only) complaint against francis ford coppola 's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia, which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour, loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler, kinder ages. 
 martin scorsese, another italoamerican moviemaker, confronted that perspective with his own, more down- to- earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets, movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime. 
 unfortunately for scorsese, his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola 's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies. 
 seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime. 
 this film was goodfellas, epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s. 
 goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story, told in best- seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi( who would co- write the screenplay for the film). 
 the book, as well as the film, chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill( played by ray liotta), irish- italian criminal from new york. 
 at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero( played by paul sorvino), local mob boss, and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands. 
 after couple of years, together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito( played by joe pesci), he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway( played by robert de niro). 
 three of them spend years as best friends and associates, gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history. 
 wealth, influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen( played by lorraine bracco), who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities, domestic abuse, arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business. 
 but the perfect world of"" wiseguys"" gradually begins to fall apart- tommy 's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence, jimmy 's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and, finally, henry 's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends. 
 goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory.

"plot: good ol' texan kid suddenly gets to play first- string quarterback on his high school team 's football team, in a town where football is considered religion.

 the good ol' texan boy does not approve of said man 's methods. 
 critique: 
 a fun football movie. 
 this film was obviously geared towards the teen market, with mtv behind its production, a big tv star actor in the lead role, rockin' hip music galore, and plenty of t&a. 
 having said that, i enjoyed the look and feel of the movie 
, thought james van der beek gave a solid performance, loved the slick sounds, and yup, loved that t&a! 
 i actually thought this was a comedy going in, but overall, it plays more towards the dramatic, than a comedy. 
 i also enjoyed jon voight 's performance as the stubborn dick coach, as well as many of the other character players on the team. 
 this is not a classic film by any stretch of the imagination, but it might teach some kids the hard lessons behind the"" fun"" game of football, or just allow them to have a good time for about an hour and forty- five minutes in the movie theatre( or in the comfort of their own home, depending on where you watch this stuff.) 
 all in all, i would definitely watch this movie if you like football, play football or want your kid to succeed in high school football. 
 you could also watch it if you like teen flicks with a lot of cute guys and girls running around doing their stuff. 
 and did i mention the t&a?:) little known facts about this film and its stars: james van der beek actually started acting after a concussion stopped him from playing football in real life. 
 he is the oldest of three children, and his father is a cellular phone salesman while his mom runs a gymnastics studio. 
 he 's born in connecticut and received$ 200, 000 for his role in this film. 
 actor scott caan, who plays football player"" tweeder"" in this film, is the son of famed actor james caan in real life.

"that 's exactly how long the movie felt to me. 
 there were n't even nine laughs in nine months. 
 it 's a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man, mr. hugh grant, a huge dork. 
 it 's not the whole oral- sex/ prostitution thing( referring to grant, not me) that bugs me, it 's the fact that grant is annoying. 
 not just adam sandler- annoying, we 're talking jim carrey- annoying. 
 since when do 
 eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting? 
 but, on the other hand, since when do really bad slapstick( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant 's head in joan cusack 's lap -- a scene he paid$ 60 to have included in the movie) and obscene double entendres( robin williams, the obstetrician, tells grant 's pregnant girlfriend she has"" a big pussy,"" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat, but nonetheless, grant paid$ 60 to have the exchange included in the movie) pass for comedy? 
 nine months is a predictable cookie- cutter movie with 
 no originality in humor or plot. 
 hugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist. 
 why a child psychologist? 
 so the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange: 
 kid: my dad 's an asshole. 
 grant( flutters eyelashes, offers a nervous smile, then responds in his annoying english accent and i- think- i- actually- have- talent attitude): could you possibly elaborate on that? 
 kid: 
 my dad 's a_ huge_ asshole. 
 more like a hugh asshole, but that 's beside the point, which is: nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief. 
 so, anyway, grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction( fluttered eyelashes, nervous smiles). 
 this paves the way for every possible pregnancy/ child birth gag in the book, especially since grant 's equally annoying friend 's wife is also pregnant. 
 the annoying friend is played by tom arnold, who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick, none of which is funny, such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed"" arnie the dinosaur""( you draw your own parallels on that one) in a toy store.

"you 've probably heard the one about the priest and the rabbi, but never with the same dosage of featherweight charm that is sprinkled over` keeping the faith'. 
 it 's a fluffy comedy, thoroughly glazed with a sense of innocuous innocence and good cheer, regarding two moral topics -- love and religion -- and how a romantic triangle causes the two to collide head- on. 
 as youngsters, brian finn, jacob schramm and anna reilly were an inseparable trio. 
 while their friendship progressed, anna always had the compassion to shower them both with the same love and support, so neither would feel excluded. but tragedy soon struck, as anna was forced to move away. 
 now adults, brian( edward norton) and jacob( ben stiller) hold similar but contrastive jobs. 
 the likable and kind- hearted father brian is a catholic priest, while the spry and outgoing jacob acts as a jewish rabbi. 
 on the basketball court, they refer to themselves as` the god squad'. 
 in the relationship field, brian abides by his catholic principle of celibacy, but jacob has reached the point where finding a jewish bride is practically mandatory. 
 everything changes when anna( jenna elfman) returns to new york to visit her childhood chums. 
 now a workaholic, she devotes endless hours per week to her business, but does find spare time to reminisce with brian and jacob- both ecstatic about seeing their elementary school sweetheart once again. 
 with these oddball ingredients tossed into one cocktail, there 's bound to be some awkward romance between our three central characters. 
 predicting the outcome is not entirely difficult, but` keeping the faith' is open, entertaining and refreshingly relaxed as it travels en route from point a 
 to point b. 
 edward norton has emerged as one of the finest, most flexibly versatile actors in hollywood- a success story sparked by his critically lauded debut in the 1996 thriller` primal fear'. after shockingly bitter roles in` american history x' and, most recently, david fincher 's vicious` fight club', a quaint romantic comedy might seem like a peculiar choice. 
 not in the least. 
 norton slips into the director 's chair for the first time with` keeping the faith', and here his incisive, resourceful approach helps add additional craft to a surprisingly perceptive screenplay by stuart blumberg.

"starring arnold schwarzenegger; danny devito; emma thompson& frank langella the only thing that you can say about junior is that it is a disappointment, and a big one at that. 
 junior brings together arnold schwarzenegger and danny devito with director ivan reitman. 
 these are the same men that brought us the very funny twins. 
 so foolish me, i was hoping for something that would at least come close to the level of quality of twins. 
 so much for hopes. 
 schwarzenegger and devito play two scientists( doctors hesse and arbogast) who are working on a new drug that will reduce the possibility of miscarriage in pregnancy. 
 unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond their control, they are denied permission to test this new drug on humans, and subsequently lose their funding. 
 still believing that their drug will work, they decide to test it anyway, on hesse. 
 so, dr. 
 hesse( schwarzenegger) artificially inseminates himself and begins taking the drug. 
 their theory is that if the drug can prevent a man from miscarrying, surely it will work on a woman. 
 does the thought of arnold schwarzenegger pregnant sound funny or humorous to you? 
 well, it must have to the producers of junior. 
 admittedly, schwarzenegger has the comedic talent to pull it off. 
 perhaps if it had been done differently it might have actually been funny. 
 but it was n't, schwarzenegger pregnant is goofy at best. 
 the sight of schwarzenegger running around going through the hormone imbalances that come with pregnancy, and the accompanying emotional swings, is not funny. 
 schwarzenegger comes very close to embarrassing himself with these antics. 
 i kept thinking to myself, with the time arnold wasted making this turkey he could have been making an action picture. 
 better yet, with schwarzenegger, devito and reitman all in the same place at the same time, why did n't they make a sequel to twins? anything would have been better than this mess. 
 danny devito is wasted in this movie. 
 his part could have been played by any joker they pulled in off the street. 
( after seeing the movie, if i was devito, i probably would have wished they had pulled someone in off the street.) 
 emma thompson is wasted here as well. 
 while thompson is best known for her jane austin adaptations, she is also a fine comedian. 
 too bad 
 she did n't get to use any of that talent here. 
 am i being too hard on this film? 
 i do n't think so.

"at first glance, daylight would seem like your typical disaster movie. 
 on second glance it looks that way too. 
 although, as typical disaster movies go, daylight is n't that bad. 
 admittedly, it seems to rip off a great deal of its plot devices from disaster flicks of days gone by( think poseidon adventure). 
 but the decent dialogue and surprisingly good acting make up for the"" have n't i seen this scene somewhere before? 
"" feeling that creeps up all too often during the film. 
 sylvester stallone stars as the recently fired head of new york 's emergency response team. 
 by sheer luck, he is in the right place at the right time when disaster strikes the unaware inhabitants of this little film. 
"" 
 what disaster is that? 
"" 
 you ask, as you inch ever closer to the edge of your seat. 
 glad you asked. 
 through a whole sequence of entirely probable events( about as probable as hitting the lottery) a large explosion takes place in the lincoln tunnel running under the hudson river in new york city. 
 the explosion results in the tunnel collapsing at both ends, which causes not only massive loss of life, but traps a dozen people inside the wreckage of the tunnel. 
 good old sly, who is only feet away from entering the tunnel when it collapses, offers his services to the rescuers, who gladly accept it. 
 sly then enters the tunnel through a vent shaft( think judge dredd) which he can only go in, and not out off, and proceeds to try to rescue those trapped inside. 
 so begins the fun, but the fun has to be quick, because this tunnel has started to spring a leak. 
 the acting is about what you would expect of a stallone movie. 
 not superb by any means, but far above some of his other films 
( think judge dredd again). 
 daylight 's acting is probably average, or a little above, in terms of this sort of genre, starring this particular star. 
 amy brenneman is the only actor of any note, and she does a pretty good job as stallone 's reluctant helper. 
 oh yeah, 
 stallone 's real life son, sage, is in this too. 
 sage -- nice name.

"lengthy and lousy are two words to describe the boring drama 
 the english patient. 
 great acting, music and cinematography were nice, but too many dull sub- plots and characters made the film hard to follow 
. 
 ralph fiennes( strange days, schindler 's list) gives a gripping performance as count laszlo almasy, a victim of amnesia and horrible burns after world war ii in italy. 
 the story revolves around his past, in flashback form, making it even more confusing. 
 anyway, he is taken in by hana( juliette binoche, the horseman on the roof), a boring war- torn nurse. 
 she was never really made into anything, until she met an indian towards the end, developing yet another sub- plot. 
 count almasy begins to remember what happened to him as it is explained by a stranger( willem dafoe, basquiat). 
 his love( kirstin scott thomas, mission impossible) was severely injured in a plane crash, and eventually died in a cave. 
 he returned to find her dead and was heart- broken. 
 so he flew her dead body somewhere, but was shot down from the ground. 
 do n't get the wrong idea, it may sound good and the trailer may be tempting, but good is the last thing this film is. 
 maybe if it were an hour less, it may have been tolerable, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of talking is too much to handle. 
 the only redeeming qualities about this film are the fine acting of fiennes and dafoe and the beautiful desert cinematography. 
 other than these, the english patient is full of worthless scenes of boredom and 
 wastes entirely too much film.,

"when robert forster found himself famous again after appearing in"" jackie brown"", he immediately signed up for a little film called"" american perfekt"". 
 this was almost two years ago. 
 i waited patiently for the film to be released, but it never was. 
 finally, i forgot about it. 
 the other day, though, while i was perusing the selection of the local video store, i stumbled upon, you guessed it,"" american perfekt"". 
 i immediately rented it and with a certain amount of glee, rushed home to view it. 
 having now seen the film, i understand why it never saw theatrical release. 
"" american perfekt"" is a jumbled mess. 
 the storyline is non- existent. 
 it took me half the movie just to figure out what was going on 
. 
 and at that point, the only thing i really knew for sure was that the movie was* never* going to introduce a plot of some sort. 
 it wants to get by on quirkyness and so- called charm alone, and it just does n't work. 
 robert forster plays a psychiatrist who picks up amanda plummer, and they head off on the road together. 
 along the way to no discernable destination, they run into all sorts of kooky and wacky characters. 
 i suppose this free- wheeling, no plot style is supposed to give the film an element of danger and excitment, but all it did was make me sleepy. 
 i 'm all for trying new things within the realm of film, but not at the expense of coherence. 
 nothing in this movie makes sense. 
 the actions of the characters go unexplained, even when they 're truly bizarre. 
 i 'll give you an example, without giving too much away. 
 david thewlis has a part as a drifting con- man. 
 at one point, mid- way through the movie, he runs forster and plummer off the road with his car. 
 as he passes them, we see that his face is covered in blood. 
 do you think we would get an explanation as to what happened to him? 
 you would think so, would n't you. 
"" american perfekt"" is a waste of time. 
 nothing is gained from watching this movie, except maybe a migraine.

"mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival. 
 as you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival. 
 it may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time 
. 
 in fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry. 
 toward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart. 
 the film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot 
 and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it. 
 something else is what he did. 
 the film opens with a woman( played by laura harring) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life. 
 she crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep. 
 meanwhile young vivacious betty( naomi watts) arrives in hollywood from canada. 
 she wants to build a career as an actress. 
 betty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow. 
 she does not know who the woman is. 
 she is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is. 
 they fix on a name rita for her, but are not sure if this right or not. 
 meanwhile local director adam kesher( justin theroux) has problems of his own. 
 he is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else, cammie rhodes( melissa george). 
 these two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong. 
 there is also a strange character called the cowboy( monty montgomery) adding to the confusion. 
 in what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits. 
 a lot of mulholland drive starts out fun. 
 lynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film. 
 he just chooses not to. 
 as with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason. 
 there are no earthworms, but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches. 
 the film is a little long for the subject matter. 
 toward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes, clearly not intended for the tv pilot.",negative,"The sentiment is negative because the reviewer criticizes the movie ""Mulholland Drive"" for falling apart towards the end. The reviewer finds the film confusing and unnecessarily long, and criticizes the director for adding strange material for little reason."
"battlefield 
 long, boring and just plain stupid battlefield earth a film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman in my mid- teen years, i had a horrendous re- occurring nightmare. 
 behind the wheel of a car, i was driving down a straight road in the middle of a desert. 
 no scenery except the horizon line and the converging parallel lines of the highway.

 then the psychlo make a mistake and capture feisty jonnie goodboy tyler( barry pepper) who organizes a revolution against chief of security terl( john travolta) and the alien race. 
 it 's an archetypal post- apocalyptic plot full of promise. 
 considering some of the talent involved and all the millions thrown at the screen, it 's difficult to see how it could have failed so miserably. 
 but it does. 
 the story is so full of holes that it falls apart within minutes of the opening credits.

 kenny, a poor kid who gets killed in every episode, and talks with his coat hood covering his head. 
 stan a regular, sometimes boring kid who has problems with women. and kyle a lonely jew who talks to his poop.

 but when the kids get up to the movie to get the tickets, they learn the movie is rated r, which of course means that anyone under the age of 17 can not get in without a parent or legal guardian.

"this was the last carry on movie( if you discount' carry on columbus' as a carry on movie) and was made by a new production company. 
 based in central london, this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert( suzanne danielle) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador( kenneth williams). 
 when he seems unwilling, she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes, such as the prime minister and the u. s. ambassador. 
 her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages. 
 she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead. 
 meanwhile, theodore valentine( larry dann) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her. 
 however, she is only interested in restoring her husband 's ardour which seems a little difficult after emile 's accident with a church spire! 
 this film is the second worst carry on movie, the worst being' carry on england'. 
 it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written. 
 newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid( as mrs. 
 valentine) are mildly funny, but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad. 
 kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted, given the script. 
 the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler, joan sims as mrs. 
 dangle, kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur, and peter butterworth as richmond, are worthless and embarassing 
. 
 in fact, all four parts are surplus to requirements. 
 however, the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades. 
 an awful script, a terrible collection of jokes, very poor production values( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st. 
 james palace), a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score, and a non- existent plot or storyline. 
 its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next!

"since director steven zaillian previously wrote the powerful screenplay for 1993 's steven spielberg drama"" schindler 's list"" and directed 1993 's intelligent"" searching for bobby fischer,"" his new film,"" a civil action,"" should most likely be looked upon as an unfortunate misstep in an otherwise prosperous career. 
 what does n't make sense is how such high- profile and superb actors as john travolta, robert duvall, william h. macy, and kathleen quinlan got involved in this project, which is both dull and completely ineffective. 
 the film, which involves a small community of children who mysteriously died of leukemia, certainly contains the type of story to be emotionally- charged, but somehow all signs of feeling have been completely removed from the proceedings, leaving us with nothing more than a poorly- done courtroom drama. 
 based on a book by jonathan hart, which was consequently based on a true account,"" a civil action"" is set in 1982 in the town of woburn, mass., where personal injury lawyer jan schlictmann( john travolta) decides to take on the case of eight families who simply want an apology for their children 's death from leukemia due to unknown causes. 
 jan originally decides to drop the case, but when he stumbles across to corporate giants, grace and beatrice foods, who have plants located near the families' homes, he sees all of the pieces suddenly fall into place: the two companies have been leaking harmful chemicals into the nearby lake which, thus, goes into the city 's drinking water. 
 suddenly, after hearing about the families' heartbreak and personal stories, he begins to care for them and becomes determined to get to the bottom of the mystery, even though he is warned by his staff accountant( william h. macy) that no money is coming in to them, only going out. 
 also figuring into the story is jerome facher( robert duvall), beatrice foods' corporate counsel, who finds himself in heated waters when jan will not accept his$ 20-million offer to settle the case. 
 coming from such a talented writer, director, and cast, not to mention one of the most interesting film composers, danny elfman,"" a civil action"" is an astoundingly empty- headed drama, one that includes an intriguing story and somehow transforms it into an admittedly tiresome and occasionally even boring experience. 
 perhaps one of its major problems was that in its attempts to be a relatively uncommercial motion picture, zaillian has misplaced its refreshing unconventional attitude with an absence of magnetism and even meaning.

"the keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber, the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse, and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest, little caper adventure entitled` where the money is.' 
 the elderly bank robber is henry( paul newman), a famous criminal that was only recently caught. 
 he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune. 
 always the shrewd thinker, he begins working on a plan to get out of jail. 
 this involves years of studying buddhism and self- hypnosis.

"ingredients: little orphan boy, rural grandparents, mountains, native american lore synopsis: in this loving film portrayal of an idyllic and pivotal time that a young boy spends with grandpa and grandma, the self recollections of an unseen narrator focus on his world view as a tennessee orphan boy learning of his heritage through his grandparents. 
 the setting is after the first world war, during the great depression years. 
 a nine- year- old orphan named little tree( joseph ashton) is taken in and taught the wondrous ways of the woods by his caucasian moonshiner grandpa( james cromwell) and his native american grandma( tantoo cardinal) in the wilderness of the mountains of tennessee. 
 here little tree learns an almost magical appreciation for nature and farm life-- and experiences beautiful and wondrous things such as the sunrise. 
 everything is miraculous to a child. 
 but it all comes crashing down for the boy when the u. s. 
 government forcibly takes custody away from grandpa and grandma, and forces little tree to attend the notched gap boarding school, a kind of internment camp where multiracial cherokee kids are indoctrinated to dress, pray, speak, and think like white people or face solitary confinement and corporeal punishment. 
 through his childhood experiences, little tree learns lessons about love, race, life, death, people, nature, and folk wisdom. 
 opinion: this excellent, excellent family movie. 
 it is one of those priceless screen gems that nobody knows about because it 's not highly advertised. 
 you wo n't find any formula schlock, cutesy characters, canned spirituality, sequel teasers or commercial tie ins, but you will find the education of little tree to be a refreshing, impeccably acted, original, wonderful, and touching film.

"warning: if you actually wish to see the film, stop reading this and see it. 
 while i do n't blow any plot details, the more you know about a movie, the more disappointing and built up it becomes( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing). 
 but, in a nutshell, it 's a good film. 
 star wars episode i: 
 the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim never having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world( i was more into star trek: the next generation), it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment, the phantom menace. 
 however, it ca n't be ignored. 
 endless toys lining the shelves, endless news reports, and a multi- billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult. 
 with the level of this hype, one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998, godzilla, which definitely failed to live up to expectations. 
 thankfully, the phantom menace does much, much better. 
 while the"" first"" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker, the prequels backpedal to tell the back- story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader). 
 without blowing too much of the story, the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo, which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation, and it 's up to two jedi knights( qui- gon ji, played by liam neeson and obi- wan kenobi, played by ewan mcgreggor) to free it. 
 the phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics, leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat. 
 common complaints range from lack of characterization, weak narrative, poor direction of actors, the dated style, and too much focus over special effects. 
 still, film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism, much of which the average film buff does not care for. hence, this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films( even with the"" improvements"" in the special editions). 
 there are many memorable sequences throughout the film, ranging from the fast and furious"" pod race"" sequence( which is a take on the chariot races in"" ben hur"") and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids.

" knock off"" is exactly that: 
 a cheap knock off of an action movie. 
 it 's also the worst movie i have seen thus far this year. 
 i figured it would be at least a couple of months before i saw the worst film of 1998, but alas, it has already been found. 
 jean- claude van damme stars as( i think) a designer jeans executive who discovers his half- brother has been supplying him with cheaper goods. 
 rob schneider plays van damme 's partner, and rochon plays... 
 actually, i have no idea who rochon was supposed to be. 
 she just sort of popped up halfway through without an explanation as to why she was there. 
 many things are not explained in this film, but i do know that for some bizarre reason, van damme seemed to be doing a jackie chan impression throughout the flick. 
 where chan comes off as endearing in his"" normal guy"" character seen in many of his films, van damme 
 just comes off as a wimp. 
 we 're never given any clear explanation as to the basis for many of his actions. 
 to be more clear: i did not even know who he was supposed to be until about an hour into the movie, and even then, it was not made too clear. 
 the film has been directed in the style of some strange film experiment gone horribly wrong. 
 tsui hark( who directed van damme 's last movie, the bad, but not nearly as bad as this,"" double team"") never lets the camera rest for a second, and that 's no exaggeration. 
 we are even treated to a five second shot from the point of view of van damme 's foot entering a shoe. 
 fabulous! 
 seriously, though, i have no problem with directors who want to play around with film conventions, as long as they do n't get carried away. 
 for example, look at sam raimi. 
"" army of darkness"", one of his best movies, features some of the most inventive camera work i have ever seen, but raimi never lets the special effects get in the way of story. 
 that 's a concept that tsui ca n't seem to grasp. 
 the special effects and outrageous camera angles* rule

"you 've got to love disney. 
 no matter what they serve up, it is a guaranteed success as long as it 's animated. 
 kids have to go see the movie. 
 then they have to get the toys. 
 oh, the video came out? 
 got to buy it, or risk little billy 's temper tantrums for the next month. 
 all of this culminates in the childhood equivalent of a pilgrimage to mecca: a visit to the magic kingdom.

 eat an ice cream mickey mouse on a stick! 
 it 's both a vertical and horizontal monopoly when you think about it. 
 dale carnegie should have had it so good. 
 what 's most amazing is that all this success is in spite of a severe lack of originality. 
 you see, disney animated features these days have two components: theme and plot. 
 the theme changes with each new movie; the plot does not. 
 the plot is a mold into which the characters of some ancient fable are dropped, and try as they might to rise above the characters of previous features, they are nearly always destined to do no more than the same. 
 however, while the success of a disney animated feature is generally a given as far as box- office receipts, merchandising dollars, and glimmers in the eyes of little children, critically they are as varied as anything else that hollywood has to offer. 
 luckily, disney 's latest animated offering, mulan, manages to be engaging and refreshing, even while rife with formula. 
 the film starts with the invasion of ancient china by the huns, led by the imposing shan- yu( miguel ferrer). 
 soon, china 's emperor( pat morita) mobilizes his armies and decrees that one male from each family in the country shall serve to fight in china 's defense. 
 when the fa family is served notice, it is the elderly father, fa zhou 
( soon- tek oh) who must answer the call, as there are no other males in the household. 
 fearing her father will surely be killed in battle, fa mulan( ming- na wen) disguises herself as a man and sneaks off with the royal orders to join the chinese army. 
 mulan, based on a chinese epic poem, is a classic tale of the triumph of the ugly duckling. 
 mulan herself is a disgrace to her loving family, as she has a difficult time fitting into the traditional woman 's role, and in a very amusing",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer praises Disney's success and the movie Mulan.

"it 's not a bad thing to update old stories. 
 it 's done all the time in the oral tradition. 
 the difficulty with this film is not that the tale has changed, it 's that it 's dry. 
 the new cinderella, danielle( drew barrymore) is not sitting around waiting for her prince to come. 
 she 's a woman of the late twentieth century albeit situated in sixteenth century france. 
 when her father dies, she stays on in his house even though she is mistreated by her wicked stepmother rodmilla( anjelica huston). 
 she works by day, but reads sir thomas more by firelight at night. 
 although the story is updated, you know the plot. 
 danielle meets prince henry( dougray scott), goes to a ball disguised, is later found out and they live happily ever after. 
 the movie is often like watching a filmed play. 
 theater in real life is engrossing. 
 theater on the screen is usually lifeless. 
 there does n't seem to be much going on. 
 the camera can be a star of films. 
 here it 's a 
 co- conspirator. 
 danielle 's convictions are compromised. 
 a socialist and a feminist, she pretends to be royalty to get her man. 
 a kind woman, her last act in the movie is one of revenge. 
 the most enjoyable characters are the most cartoonish. 
 the fairy godmother stand- in, leonardo da vinci( patrick godfrey) is fun to watch as the eccentric old man who advises danielle. 
 huston is enjoyable in her over- the- top wickedness. 
 in all fairness, my companion loved the film.

 it is certainly a date film. 
 nearly the entire audience was couples.

"walt disney studios may have finally met its match with the lush animation in twentieth century fox 's anastasia. 
 but judging by the latest efforts from the don bluth studios, the visuals are 
 the only thing fox has to brag about. 
 disney 's recent classics have occasionally stretched credibility in such films as pocahontas, the hunchback of notre dame, and to a lesser extent, hercules. 
 with anastasia, fox has gone so far as to throw all facts completely out the window. 
 some may say- so what? 
 it 's just a kid 's movie. 
 well. 
.. 
 if you have young kids, beware, as they may be noticeably frightened by the visuals of a corpse- rotting rasputin zombie, whose body parts continually fall off in a disconcertingly real way. 
 consider yourselves warned. 
 nevertheless, the animation is quite stunning at times. 
 don bluth has used computer animation extensively throughout, occasionally rivalling photographic quality. 
 and yet in other scenes, the hand- drawn material seems of the saturday- morning tv crowd, which leads me to wonder. 
.. 
 was this rushed to market to combat disney? 
 the plot, as anyone who had read history before knows, concerns the attempt to return anastasia to her royal family after she was lost in the overthrow of the romanovs in 1916. 
 not that anastasia is much concerned with what really happened. 
 as for the plot --- go rent disney 's candleshoe. 
 you 'll see 60% of anastasia there.

 it is mostly the pimps who do the talking for their ho 's, and the egotistical and flamboyant way you would expect them to be, is what you get. 
 i learned that the word"" bitch"" is their favorite word, as it seemed to crop up in every sentence they used. 
 it makes for a film with no surprises or nothing fresh to say, but if one has a sense a humor for what their lifestyle is about, then some of what they rap about might seem amusing.

"" wild things"" would be a guilty pleasure, only there 's no guilty feeling involved in having a good time with it. 
 high school guidance counselor sam lombardo( matt dillon) is well- liked in the town of blue bay, especially by pretty, popular kelly van ryan( denise richards), whose family name is among the florida yachting enclave 's most financially prominent. 
 hoping to take her crush to a physical level, kelly seductively slinks into lombardo 's house after washing his jeep for a fundraiser, but, the very next day, tearfully admits to her trollop mother( theresa russell) that she was raped. 
 before long, blue bay detectives ray duquette( kevin bacon) and gloria perez( daphne rubin- vega) are listening to similar allegations from kelly 's rebel classmate suzie toller( neve campbell).

 while cross- examining suzie on the witness stand, bowden gets her to break down and admit that the alleged rapes never took place -- that kelly had concocted this entire scheme because she was angry that lombardo was sleeping with her mother and not with her.

"in tim burton 's` sleepy hollow', there is a mysterious headless horseman who decapitates residents of the small town of the same name. 
 he rides a beautiful black steed and carries an imposing sword that cauterizes the wound of his victims with an immediate swipe. 
 burton 's update on washington irving 's classic tale of` the legend of sleepy hollow' offers us the mystery of the horseman, when the screenplay should have merely settled on the aspect of the horror. 
 writer andrew kevin walker(` seven') 
 throws in perhaps too healthy a dosage of sherlock holmes, but the visual treatment of the film is absolutely entrancing, as burton offers foggy locales and detailed costumes that are gorgeous and stirring to examine 
. 
 as` sleepy hollow' opens, we 're greeted with a juicy cameo from martin landau, who won an oscar in burton 's` ed wood'. 
 landau plays a prominent citizen of sleepy hollow, who, on a fateful carriage ride through the forest, is decapitated by an unseen horseback rider. 
 after two more murders haunt the residents of the quaint little town, constable ichabod crane( johnny depp) is sent in to investigate. 
 landlord baltus von tassel( michael gambon) explains to crane that the heads have been severed from the carcass and mysteriously taken in each separate case, and that they believe the murderer is a dead hessian trooper( played briefly by a wonderfully jarring christopher walken) who has risen from the grave after being decapitated in the western woods. 
 crane is not a man of great superstition, and is determined to root out the human culprit with his assortment of gizmos and gadgets( things i was not surprised to find in a tim burton movie). 
 first and foremost,` sleepy hollow' is a fun horror film. 
 as with virtually all burton movies, we are treated to a wonderful score by composer danny elfman, who has once again poured excitement and imagination into an atmospheric soundtrack that accentuates the gothic mood perfectly. 
 the horseman f/ x are stylish and impressive, particularly in perfectly blended battle sequences involving actual actors. 
 but why did i enjoy` sleepy hollow' as much as i did? 
 although enjoyable, it was not the numerous beheadings and the plentiful gore that spurted 
 left and right.. 
 it was the light comic touch that burton applied. 
 the film has the sweetness of a candy apple, usually channeled through depp 's wonderful performance as the lovable geek ichabod crane, who is no longer a mild- mannered school teacher but still attains his cowardly qualities.

"it 's been a good 
 long while since we had a good old fashioned thriller, where mostly everything goes right for the audience and wrong for the characters, 
 but it 's been even longer since i saw a thriller that actually* shock* cared for the characters, not merely judged them but actually allowed their human foibles, flaws, and strengths to emerge so radiantly. 
 i 'd saw that it 's been at least a couple decades, even as far back to the great hitchcock thrillers, though i 'm hardly comparing"" a simple plan"" to, say,"" rear window"" or"" strangers on a train. 
"" 
 yet it 's almost as good. 
 it 's simple, yet strangely complex, and astonishingly rewarding, because instead of moving from plot point to plot point, and merely laying out they- might- be- caught overtones, it instead concerns itself with the moral corruption and depths of greed that its protagonists can go to, all without ever judging them as either evil or even immoral. 
 elegantly directed by sam raimi( yes, the same),"" a simple plan"" concerns itself with the discovery of a crashed plane and within a bag full of millions of dollars by an upright, moderately financially stable working man( bill paxton), his dim- witted brother( billy bob thornton), and his drinking buddy( brent briscoe). without anyone around, and the possibility that no one would come looking for it, the three debate and debate but finally reach the decision that yes, they will keep it, but until any authorities or possible owners of the cash come looking, and so they generally do n't flaunt anything they do n't want to flaunt, they 'll keep it stored away in the custody of paxton. 
 the possibilites of this circumstance are much diverse: a) they could endlessly play cat and mouse with the authorities; b) they could try to fight off the rightful owners, who are either villainous or just; or c) they could fight amongst themselves. 
"" 
 a simple plan,"" though borrows a little from each of these. 
 a little tiff with the cops here, a subplot involving an alleged fbi agent( a chilling gary cole) there), and a bit of inside feuding over here.

"it 's rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year, but that is what disney and pixar animation; s latest film represents. 
 while a bugs life is n't nearly as deep as it 's predecessor, dreamwork 's antz, 
 it is just as funny. 
 a bug 's life centers, appropriately, around the life of an ant, named flik. 
 flik, cutely voiced by newsradio 's david foley, hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task. 
 when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost, the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way. 
 the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them. 
 the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper, who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey. 
 when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food. 
 when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission, they never dream he will be successful, they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food. 
 flik 's mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return. 
 instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs, who he mistakenly assumes are warriors. 
 when he returns with the` warriors', the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes. 
 a bug 's life has animation that is simply stunning.

 men in black does n't wait to get to the fun.

 naturally nobody believes his story... 
 nobody that is, except for the top secret organization that not even the government is aware of. 
 edwards then meets agent kay, the man who never seems to crack a smile, and is introduced to the mib. 
 edwards winds up joining the team and is stripped of anything that can point back to him( birth certificate, drivers license, and even the literal removal of his fingerprints).

 down periscope stars kelsey"" frasier"" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer 's( james coburn) plan to get him out of the navy. 
 like any lame emsemble comedy, the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out, the fat guy who eats all the time, the beautiful woman who does n't belong there( lauren holly), the second- in- command who does everything by the book( rob schneider), the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out( harry dean stanton) and so on. 
 then comes the transparent plotline. 
 first grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him, and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage

 following in the foot steps of mtv 's two other live action films, joe 's apartment( 1996) and dead man on campus( 1998), varsity blues is a bad film and is unlikely to cause much of a sensation in the marketplace. 
 set in west cannan, texas, the film examines the small town obsession with high school football through the eyes of second string quarterback john"" mox"" moxon( van der beek). 
 we know he 's smart because he reads kurt vonnegut instead of the playbook. 
 coach bud kilmer( jon voight) has been around so long there is actually a bronze statue commemorating him. 
 the star quarterback, lance harbor( paul walker), is a handsome, blonde, hero who has his own billboard in his front yard and dates the sexy head cheerleader, darcy( ali larter). 
 also on the team are an enormous guy( ron lester) with some health problems and the token african- american team member( eliel swinton) whose only real dialogue scene deals directly with the color of his skin. 
 when lance is seriously injured, mox gets his chance to shine and he runs with it, undermining kilmer with his unusual playing strategies. 
 his relationship with his dutiful girlfriend, jules( amy smart), is threatened and there 's a big game at the end. 
 guess who wins? 
 nothing about varsity blues is inspired and the whole film simply moves through the sort of conventional motions that coach kilmer would love. 
 there 's a chance for some smart satire on small town obsessions but the humor here is decidedly lowbrow

"robert benton has assembled a stellar, mature cast for his latest feature, twilight, a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood. 
 paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross. 
 harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames( gene hackman and susan sarandon), a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight. 
 when jack sends him on a routine delivery job, however, the old instincts kick in. 
 soon, harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line, and he no longer knows who to trust. 
 there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight, in addition to newman, hackman and sarandon. 
 james garner plays raymond hope, a former cop and one of harry 's best friends. 
 stockard channing plays verna, harry 's former partner, and possibly a former love interest. 
 reese witherspoon is mel, the distrustful daughter of the ames', and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend. 
 giancarlo esposito appears as harry 's bumbling detective protigi, and john spencer is a suspicious police captain. 
 with a cast like that, it 's almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze. 
 luckily, there 's more to the film than some sort of actor 's recognition ceremony. 
 twilight has a solid film noir- ish plot. 
 it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics, but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days. 
 the major cast members all deliver strong performances, as can be expected of their caliber. 
 however, none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable. 
 the supporting cast is enjoyable, if a little underdrawn. 
 stockard channing 's character, in particular, is a cipher. 
 there 's more to her character than the film takes the time to describe. 
 it 's a minor, but irritating, flaw. 
 with a solid cast, and a good plot 
, there 's a lot to recommend about twilight. 
 it 's biggest flaw is actually its short running time. 
 at a slim 94 minutes, there 's a lot of stuff that 's packed into an awfully small package. 
 still, the chance to see newman, sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two.

"some talented actresses are blessed with a demonstrated wide acting range while others, almost as gifted, have more limited types of parts for which they are suitable. 
 as was amply evident after basic instinct, sharon stone can play sensual roles with great abandon. rejecting her natural abilities, she has spent the rest of her entire career trying with little success to play against type. 
 gloria is her latest disaster. 
 babe ruth did n't quit baseball after one season to play football in a quixotic quest to prove his athletic dexterity, and neither should stone reject what she does best. 
 janeane garofalo, for example, is no less wonderful an actress because she could have never pulled off stone 's part in basic instinct; neither is stone any less talented because she could n't do garofalo 's comedic roles. 
 gloria, directed by respected director sidney lumet and adapted by steve antin from the 1980 screenplay by john cassavetes, was not screened in advance for critics, 
 almost always a sign that the studio is n't behind the picture. 
 after seeing it in a nearly empty audience after it opened, it is clear why they held it from the press. 
 it is a film more to be endured than enjoyed. 
 as the story opens, an angry gloria( stone) is being released from prison after 3 years confinement. 
 she 's got a bad attitude and a big mouth. 
 she also has a bad case of wavering and overblown new york accents, a disease suffered by much of the rest of the cast. 
 an annoying child actor named jean- luke figueroa plays a soon- to- be orphan named nicky.

 magoo' was by far the worst ever made, the spectacularly bad' blue in the face', the horrible' baby genuises' and now' i woke up early the day i died'. 
 it may not however be the worst movie made but it certainly ranks as one bad movie.

 well mediocre to me.

 after escaping from a mental institution' the thief' played by billy zane goes out in the real world and finds that it is pretty harsh and gritty.

 he ends up in a cemetery where he puts his money in a coffin to keep it for later, comes back and realizes that someone took it and put it somewhere. 
 now he is determined to kill all the visitors at the funeral earlier that day until he gets his money back, ultimately leading to a finale that is less that satisfying. 
 a film which was based on a' long- lost' script by ed wood, i have only one question: no dialogue, only music and movement 
 where exactly is the point? 
 the film moves along at a rather slow pace, but does have one advantage: the soundtrack which is catchy and vibrant except the first song which can be offensive to some. 
 it opens with a fun, innovative opening credits sequence and quickly goes downhill after that. 
 some of the low points are when' the thief' steals a woman 's purse, and then she faints, sandra bernhard as a dancer and tippi hendren as a deaf woman whom' the thief' kills to the music of' psycho'. come on people get some new ideas already!

 his latest film,"" the butcher boy,"" is a return to his roots in ireland, but unfortunately, it is not a successful homecoming 
. 
 told through the eyes of a 12-year- old irish boy, francis( newcomer eomann owens), this peculiar film follows him as we learn a little about his decidedly unstable life. 
 his father( stephen rea) is an indifferent alcoholic, his mother( fiona shaw) is mentally ill and always in and out of hospitals, and francis himself delights in terrorizing the mother of one of his friends after he is forbidden to see him anymore. 
 francis is the type of boy who always has a lot to say, but 
 mostly fluctuates between sarcasm and frightening honesty, and it quickly becomes apparent that he may very well be a little psychotic, even capable of brutal murder. 
 the premise of,"" the butcher boy,"" is one that could have very well been turned into a thought- provoking, disturbing motion picture, but somehow nothing works 
. 
 francis is in almost every scene, but we learn very little about him, as if the film was distancing itself away from him when, i suspect, we were actually supposed to sympathize with him. 
 this is definately not young owens fault, however, because he gives a brilliantly accurate performance, and is able to also seem menacing as well. 
 the fact that we do n't get close to his character is because of the sloppy screenplay. 
 the supporting characters are no help, though. 
 rea is wasted, and has practically no scenes where he actually talks to his son, or to anyone else for that matter. 
 he usually seems to just be sitting watching the television throughout. 
 shaw has a little bit more to work with, since she has one touching scene in which she talks to francis in a time of despair, but is out of the picture just as we are beginning to know her. and singer sinead o'connor appears rather effectively as the virgin mary who occasionally gives francis advice.

"contact is the 1997 movie i 've seen the most- five times to be exact. 
 four of those times were on the big screen, but even on a tv, 
 it 's a very impressive film. 
 the same ca n't be said for films like independance day, but that 's because contact is a rare example in sci- fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects, and all of us know looking back that id4 did n't offer much outside of some one- time delightful eye candy. 
 contact 's wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway( jodie foster), a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of"" merely listening"" to sounds out in space. 
 her interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age, encouraged by her loving father, ted( david morse), who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola, fl( that was, of course, before the days of internet chat rooms). 
 while everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra- terrestrial intelligence( of which the program seti is an acronym for), ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on, keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive. 
 ellie 's strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist, a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young. 
 in puerto rico, she meets palmer joss( matthew mcconaughey), a writer examining the effects of technology on the world 's overall happiness; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as"" a man of the cloth, without the cloth"". 
 despite the vast differences in opinion regarding a"" supreme being"", ellie and palmer hit it off, and even take the time to sleep together. 
 it 's a weak and hurried relationship, but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on. 
 meanwhile, dr. 
 david drumlin( tom skerritt), who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money, is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding. 
 this leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors, eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation, and only a one night stand to remember.

"ever since wargames, the first real computer hacking movie, hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking. 
 these films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous. 
 if it 's not this, the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect. 
 hackers is guilty of all of these crimes. 
 to anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet, most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you ca n't take it anymore. 
 those of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web, the internet movie database, are probably aware of the section for movies entitled"" goofs"". 
 this is the section for mistakes in the movies. 
 well, imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed: 
"" generally ill- informed and ridiculous to the extreme 
 regarding the capabilities of computers and technology"". 
 and truthfully, this is one- hundred percent correct. 
 the plot, obviously, centers around computer hacking. 
 more specifically, it follows the exploits of dade murphy, a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller. 
 miller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting, because if it were not for that, who knows where his career would be now after hackers. 
 the film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems. 
 he was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old. 
 the film then picks up at that point, an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer. 
 dade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn( angelina jolie), cereal killer( matthew lillard), lord nikon( laurence mason), and the phantom phreak( renoly santiago), who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible: hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi. 
 oh, 
 and as a little sub- plot, dade also tries to woo acid burn, the only female hacker in the film. 
 really, i ca n't think of much more to say about the film 's plot aside from what i 've said. 
 it 's just a bunch of computer geeks( no, obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi. 
 thanks to this movie, the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do.

"an attempt at florida film noir, palmetto fails at the most fundamental levels. 
 it 's slow moving, uninvolving, and plain just uninteresting. 
 harry barber( woody harrelson) is an ex- newspaper man, just out of jail after being framed for a crime. 
 his luck has n't been the best, but things are looking up when a mysterious woman, rhea malroux( elisabeth shue), approaches him with a proposition. 
 she wants harry to help her and her stepdaughter, odette( chloe sevigny), pull off a fake kidnapping scheme to get$ 500, 000 out of her stingy, but rich, husband felix( rolf hoppe). 
 at first, all harry is expected to do is provide a threatening voice on the phone, and to collect the money( of which he gets to keep 10%). 
 but, as the deed is carried out, things are not what they seem, and harry gets caught in the ensuing storm. 
 palmetto pulls out all the stops to achieve a film noir film, but the effect never quite comes together 
. 
 it 's got the sultry florida heat, seductive women, and even curvier plot twists, but the whole thing smells of paint- by- numbers. 
 sure, the right ingredients are there, but the end result is much too artificial. 
 a lot of the problems lie with the script, which, though providing some genuine surprises, is packed full of leaden dialogue and bland situations. 
 even the plot twists do n't seem to flow well with the rest of the story. 
 some of them, for example, come from so far afield that they seemingly only make sense because the writer needed a twist( for example: harry 's spontaneous job offer, or the whole typewriter situation). 
 the characters are mostly lifeless, played to type, but not much more 
. 
 woody harrelson plays harry with such imbecilic thick- headedness that it 's hard to even picture him as an ex- journalist. 
 elisabeth shue vamps it up, but does n't add anything special to the role. 
 chloe sevigny gives a terrible performance, trying to be a sexy 17-year old, but she just leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

"the thirteenth floor, the third in what i would call"" the reality check movie series"", is very similar to the other reality check movies released this year, the matrix and existenz. 
 all three made you think, made you wonder what is real, what is n't, and if our world is just a huge game. 
 the thirteenth floor does n't reach the level of originality, creativity, and curiosity sparked by the matrix and existenz, but it certainly gives a great shot at it. 
 in the matrix, we were told that the humans are simply a virus. 
 in existenz, we learned that our life could be just a game. 
 in the thirteenth floor, we learn that we are just electronic devices, living under another world of electronic devices. 
 there is just one world on top of another, and everything in them are fake and electronically generated. 
 the thirteenth floor took a huge, risky turn that i did n't expect it to take, and i 'm not very sure it was such a great turn to make. rather than focusing just on the reality parts of the film, the thirteenth floor becomes a murder mystery that ends up tying in with the different worlds. 
 after the mysterious murder of computer program designer hammond fuller, played by armin mueller- stahl, douglas hall, played by craig bierko, a man that worked under fuller for many years, must travel through an electronic computer device that fuller was using, to the year 1937, which consists of computer generated characters only. 
 the simulation of 1937 is just like it was back in the olden days. 
 all of the people involved are just characters, or are they? 
 douglas strongly believes that a character traveled through the transport from their world to ours, and killed fuller. 
 along the way, douglas interacts with many different potential suspects, and a woman who claims to be the daughter of fuller, jane fuller, played wonderfully by a talented young actress, gretchen mol. 
 the thirteenth floor is a plot driven movie from the time the film gets going, and does n't use spectacular special effects and big sound to keep the viewer 's interests. 
 i was worried that this film would be too much like the matrix and existenz, and i would n't enjoy it, but 
 there were enough twists and turns to keep me thinking and attentive to the film. 
 unfortunately, many potential would have been great scenes were thrown away with predictable content, letting the viewer know the outcome of the scene long before it happened.

The reviewer also praises the performance of actress Gretchen Mol and the unexpected twists in the movie.
"there 's some movies i enjoy even though i know i probably should n't and have a difficult time trying to explain why i did. 
"" lucky numbers"" is a perfect example of this because it 's such a blatant rip- off of"" fargo"" and 
 every movie based on an elmore leonard novel and yet 
 it somehow still works for me. 
 i know i 'm in the minority here but let me explain. 
 the film takes place in harrisburg, pa in 1988 during an unseasonably warm winter. 
 john travolta plays the local big- shot tv weatherman who is idolized by the townsfolk as if he were john travolta himself and not the bumbling russ richards. 
 russ is married to crystal( lisa kudrow), a blonde bimbo if ever there was one in the history of cinema. 
 she 's a selfish, nasty bitch full of lust and desire 
 but somehow she got the job of the lottery ball girl- 
 not exactly the most intellectually taxing job on the market. 
 crystal 's cheating on russ with their collective boss dick( ed o'neil), the tv station manager. 
 she does n't seem to genuinely like either of them, but it 's all she can do in this one- horse town. 
 much like"" fargo,"" this movie tells the story of a man who 's going broke and has to pull off a huge scam to get rich quick. 
 he enlists the help of his english friend gig( tim roth), the local stripclub owner who tells him how to fix the lottery. 
 along the way a subplot involving a two- bit thug named, accurately,"" dale the thug""( michael rappaport) gets mixed up in the process. 
 there 's also a bookie that somehow gets thrown in the mix once the deal goes down. 
 i 'm not going to elaborate much further on the plot and story because it continues to unwind and take twists and turns you 're not expecting. 
 this is a farce, which is basically a straightforward, adult- oriented comedy but does n't go as far as a classic black comedy should. 
 where as"" fargo"" was sometimes shocking and disturbing while being funny,"" lucky numbers"" is just funny because you ca n't take these characters in these outrageous situations seriously. 
 it 's all a big cartoon basically, but 
 it 's funny and i can respect that.

 he 's a creep",positive,"The review is positive because the reviewer finds the movie funny and enjoys the performances, particularly John Travolta's. The reviewer also appreciates the unexpected twists and turns in the plot, even though they acknowledge that the movie is a rip-off of other films."
"scream 2 is n't quite as clever as its predecessor, but it fills the gap with a cutting wit. 
 death -- even gruesome, bloody death -- can be funny if handled the right way 
( some will be offended by this statement, but you need look no further than pulp fiction for an example). 
 and, while there 's plenty of horror to go around in scream 2, the latest' 90s slasher flick incarnation, there are also a few laughs to be had. 
 scream 2 is a slice- and- dice movie for those who do n't take their horror too seriously. 
 the success of the original scream took everyone in the industry by surprise. 
 the unexpected blockbuster, whose gross soared over the$ 100 million mark during its six month release window, opened just about a year ago and turned into one of the most profitable horror films of all time. 
 a sequel was inevitable; fortunately, nearly the entire creative team has returned for scream 2, including director wes craven, screenwriter kevin williamson, and actors 
 neve campbell, courtney cox, david arquette, jamie kennedy, and liev schreiber. 
 as stipulated by one of the"" rules of sequels"" uttered by a movie- obsessed character in the film, the body count in scream 2 is higher than that in the original. 
 paradoxically, there 's a lot less gore. 
 there is blood, of course, but nothing excessive by slasher- movie standards, and there are no depictions of spilled entrails. 
 craven has remembered that scares are more important that graphic displays of human insides and bodily fluids. 
 a second strength of scream 2 is that it features a gallery of legitimate characters rather than a group of cardboard cut- out stereotypes lined up for slaughter. 
 after all, we 've known some of these people for two movies -- it 's almost impossible not to care about them at least a little. 
 scream 2 opens approximately two years after the original. 
 as in the first picture, there 's a slick, self- mocking prologue. 
 this time, the victims are jada pinkett and omar epps, whose characters are visiting a local theater for a preview screening of the movie stab( which is based on the"" true life"" events of scream). 
 some of the smartest dialogue comes during this sequence as pinkett bemoans the lack of african american participation in horror films( it 's surely no coincidence that, in addition to pinkett and epps, scream 2 features two black characters). 
 shortly thereafter, she and her boyfriend have been gutted,",positive,"The review is positive because it praises the movie ""Scream 2"" for its cleverness, wit, and horror. It also appreciates the return of the original creative team and the development of the characters. The reviewer also mentions the movie's success and profitability."

"118 minutes; not rated( though i suspect it would be rated pg for adult themes and language) 
 mamoru oshii is a name that probably is n't very well- known to most american audiences, but perhaps it should be. 
 oshii was the director of last year 's best- known japanese animated film import, 
_ ghost in the shell_, and is known among fans of japanese animation, or anime, for making films with a deep philosophical bent. 
 one of these films was the first theatrical venture for the patlabor animated series. 
 in its many incarnations -- graphic novels("" manga""), two different runs of made- for- video episodes( original animation videos, or oavs for short), and a television series running to nearly fifty episodes -- patlabor has proven to be one of the most popular series ever in japan. 
 set in the very near future( though it was a somewhat farther away near future when the series was first conceived), this atypical giant robot anime features the characters, rather than the machinery, as the primary focus. 
 as a whole, patlabor is the story of an exciting time for japan. 
 as the prologue to each episode of the television series explains, giant industrial robots, known as"" labors""( an interesting play on words, considering that"" robot"" is derived from the czech word for labor), have come into widespread use in japan toward the close of the twentieth century. 
 with the rise of labors, however, has come a new menace -- labor crime. 
 this led to the creation of the two special vehicle divisions, using patrol labors to fight labor crime. 
 the patlabor story centers around the second special vehicle division, sv2, who, through no fault of their own, have acquired a bad reputation for destructiveness. 
 sometimes utterly hilarious, sometimes almost deadly serious, the patlabor series explores the interpersonal relationships of the special vehicle crewmembers, and also looks at the effects of technology on modern life. 
 those who are unfamiliar with the patlabor story and characters may find themselves slightly confused coming into the movie, although there is ample background exposition provided for new viewers. 
 the story, as has much of patlabor before, centers around the controversial babylon project, a gigantic seawall that will, on its completion, allow the reclamation of thousands of square miles of land from tokyo bay. 
 this project has been an almost constant target of environmentalist terrorists, most notably the house of sea organization. 
 however, the threat in this case comes not from any terrorist,",positive,"The review is positive as it praises the director, Mamoru Oshii, and the movie for its deep philosophical themes. It appreciates the popularity of the Patlabor series in Japan and its focus on characters rather than machinery. The reviewer also provides a detailed background of the series and the movie's plot."
"synopsis: a humorless police officer 's life changes when he befriends a super- smart, super- adorable golden retriever named einstein and a cute, young blond scientist. 
 unfortunately, einstein shares a psychic link with a bigfoot- sized ape- creature trained by the blond scientist to be an unstoppable killing machine, and this rogaine- nightmare is loose and after the dog and the girl. 
 meanwhile, a group of white, chain- smoking, gun- toting nsa agents in sunglasses and business suits tries to kill all the other characters in the movie. 
 comments: watchers reborn, a cheaply made direct- to- video turkey 
, is the fourth sequel to the first film version of dean koontz 's bestselling novel watchers. 
 technically, this should have been called watchers v, but it seems that this cycle of horror movies, much like many other sequel- crazy film series, has decided to drop the numbers from the titles. 
( even the star trek movies dropped the numbers from their titles after star trek vi.) 
 the makers of watchers reborn probably want to fool unsuspecting video rental customers into thinking this might be a good movie instead of a crappy fifth installment of a film series which should have died a long time ago. 
 this really is n't a good movie. 
 have you ever rented a movie and recieved a sinking feeling about it when you watched the previews preceding the feature presentation? 
 well, any hope a viewer may have had, perhaps because he is a fan of novelist dean koontz or actor mark hamill, will be dashed by the time he 's seen the trailers tagged on before the beginning of watchers reborn. 
 they 're awful. 
 these commercials cover films like a strange stripper movie called shadow dancer, some weird crap about a dead indian, teens, and wolves, and an"" action"" movie called detonator starring scott baio. 
 scott baio! 
 what idiot dreamed this movie up? 
 after surviving these abysmal trailers, the person finally gets to watch the movie he rented: watchers reborn. 
"" 
 maybe it wo n't be 
* that 
* bad"" he may say to himself. 
"" perhaps, just perhaps, the bottom- of- the- barrel film fluff advertised before it is greatly misleading. 
 watchers reborn, after all, is based on that cool book dean koontz wrote a decade ago. 
 it stars mark hamill -- luke skywalker himself from that terrific star wars trilogy. 
 lou rawls is even in the mix! 
"" unfortunately, the force is certainly no longer with",negative,"The review is negative because it criticizes the movie ""Watchers Reborn"" for being a cheaply made sequel. It also mocks the movie's plot and characters. The reviewer also expresses disappointment with the trailers before the movie and the overall quality of the movie."
